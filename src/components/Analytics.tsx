 * GA4.

 * Loaded with afterInteractive so analytics never sits in front of the page
 * painting. `send_page_view` is left on: this site has real URL changes on
 * every navigation, so GA4's automatic page_view is accurate and we do not
 * need to fire our own.
 *
 * The measurement ID is hard-coded rather than read from an env var so the tag
 * cannot silently vanish because a Vercel variable was never set — a missing
 * tag is exactly the failure this site has been suffering from.
