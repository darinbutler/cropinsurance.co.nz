    content: `## What Is Crop Insurance?

Crop insurance protects growers against financial loss from crop damage or failure due to specified events. In New Zealand, two main types are available:

**Named Perils Insurance** covers specific, listed events such as hail, frost, fire, and wind. This is the most common form of crop insurance in NZ and is available from FMG, Gallagher, Aon, and specialist brokers. Premiums are generally lower than multi-peril cover, and the policy clearly defines what is and isn't covered.

**Multi-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI)** provides broader protection, guaranteeing a minimum yield or revenue regardless of the cause of loss. MPCI is more common in the United States and Australia but is increasingly available in NZ through specialist brokers accessing international markets via Lloyd's of London and specialist underwriters.

## Who Needs Crop Insurance in NZ?

Any grower who would suffer significant financial hardship from a crop failure should consider crop insurance. This particularly includes:

- **Orchardists** with large capital investments in orchard infrastructure and perennial crops — a single hailstorm can destroy an entire season's revenue
- **Viticulture growers** exposed to frost and hail during the growing season, particularly in Marlborough, Hawke's Bay, and Central Otago
- **Arable farmers** with significant input costs who need income certainty, especially Canterbury and Southland grain growers
- **Contract growers** who face penalty clauses if they fail to deliver contracted volumes to processors or exporters
- **Horticulture growers** with high-value per-hectare crops such as vegetables, berries, and specialist produce

## The NZ Crop Insurance Market in 2026

The NZ crop insurance market is served by several key players, each with different strengths:

**FMG (Farmers Mutual Group)** is New Zealand's largest rural insurer — a mutual organisation owned by its farming policyholders. FMG has an unrivalled network of rural advisers throughout NZ and strong expertise in named perils cover for arable, horticulture, and pastoral farms.

**Gallagher** is a global insurance broker with specialist agribusiness teams. For larger operations and complex risks, Gallagher can access international insurance markets unavailable to domestic-only insurers. They are increasingly active in parametric crop products.

**Aon NZ** brings global risk analytics alongside a strong NZ agribusiness practice. Aon is particularly well-regarded for vineyard and viticulture insurance and for data-driven risk assessments.

**Farmcover** and **Howden** round out the market with competitive products for smaller farms and niche risks.

## Key Crop Insurance Concepts You Need to Understand

### Sum Insured Basis

Your sum insured determines the maximum payout and directly affects your premium. There are three common approaches:

- **Input cost basis**: Covers only the cost of growing the crop (seeds, fertiliser, sprays, labour). The most affordable but leaves you exposed to lost profit.
- **Expected yield value**: Insures at the anticipated market value of a normal crop. Provides more meaningful protection.
- **Market value / revenue basis**: The most comprehensive approach, available under multi-peril or revenue protection policies.

### Named Perils vs. All-Risk Coverage

Named perils policies list exactly what events are covered. Common covered perils in NZ include hail, frost, fire, wind, flood, lightning, and snow. Any loss from an unlisted cause — drought, disease, pest — is not covered.

All-risk or multi-peril policies reverse this approach: everything is covered unless specifically excluded. This provides broader protection but at higher premium cost.

### Excess and Deductibles

Most crop insurance policies include an excess — the first portion of any loss that you bear yourself. A higher excess means a lower premium. For many growers, accepting a meaningful excess on smaller losses while protecting against catastrophic events is the most cost-effective structure.

## Key Things to Look For in a Policy

When comparing crop insurance policies, pay careful attention to:

1. **Sum insured basis** — is the policy based on expected yield value, market value, or input costs?
2. **Exclusions** — what perils are excluded? Pre-existing disease? Gradual deterioration? Check drought exclusions specifically.
3. **Waiting periods** — is there a waiting period before cover commences after taking out a new policy? Attempting to insure after a weather event has occurred will be declined.
4. **Claims process** — how quickly will an assessor attend after a weather event? Prompt assessment is critical for fresh produce claims.
5. **Sub-limits** — are there caps on individual peril claims that may leave you underinsured for your highest-risk peril?
6. **Season definition** — exactly when does cover start and end? This matters critically for frost cover on orchards and vineyards.

## How Much Does Crop Insurance Cost in NZ?

Premiums vary significantly based on crop type, region, coverage level, and claims history. As a rough guide for 2026:

| Crop Type | Typical Annual Premium |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Kiwifruit (commercial orchard) | $2,500 – $35,000+ |
| Apples / Pears | $1,800 – $30,000+ |
| Grapes / Vineyard | $2,000 – $45,000+ |
| Wheat / Barley (Canterbury) | $800 – $20,000+ |
| Stone Fruit | $1,500 – $16,000 |
| Vegetables | $700 – $12,000 |
| Hops | $1,200 – $12,000 |

The best way to get an accurate premium is to request quotes through a specialist crop insurance broker who can approach multiple insurers on your behalf — at no cost to you.

## When to Review Your Cover

Crop insurance should be reviewed at least annually, ideally 2–3 months before the start of your main risk season. Key triggers for an immediate review include:

- You have expanded your planted area or changed crop varieties
- You have installed or removed hail netting or frost protection infrastructure
- Your crop values or input costs have changed materially
- You have had a recent claim that may affect your renewal terms
- A significant weather event has occurred in your region

    content: `## The Kiwifruit Industry and Its Risks

New Zealand is the world's third-largest kiwifruit producer, with the Bay of Plenty region at the heart of a $3+ billion export industry. The industry has come a long way since PSA (Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae) devastated orchards in 2010–2013, but growers today face an evolving range of risks that make robust insurance cover essential.

The kiwifruit industry is dominated by Zespri — the grower-owned marketing company that manages NZ kiwifruit exports globally. Most commercial orchards grow either Zespri Green (Hayward variety) or the premium Zespri SunGold (Gold3 variety). Gold kiwifruit orchards command higher land values and higher revenues per hectare, but also represent a larger insurance exposure given the significant investment in variety licensing and orchard development.

## PSA Disease Coverage: Understanding Your Options

PSA cover is one of the most frequently asked-about topics in kiwifruit insurance. The challenge is that PSA is a biological disease, and most standard named perils policies explicitly exclude disease coverage. This reflects the fundamental difficulty insurers have in distinguishing between natural disease events and management failures. However, several meaningful options exist:

**Business interruption cover** is arguably the most important disease-related protection available to kiwifruit growers. If a PSA outbreak — or another significant disease event — forces a material reduction in your orchard's productivity over one or more seasons, business interruption cover can compensate for lost revenue during the recovery period. This type of cover does not require the cause to be a named peril; it responds to the financial impact of an operational disruption.

**Re-establishment costs** are covered under some specialist policies. If PSA or another disease forces vine removal, soil treatment, and replanting, the cost of this remediation work can reach $40,000–$80,000 per hectare. Select policies will contribute to these costs, particularly if the outbreak is confirmed as an incursion from outside your property.

**Specialist disease cover** is available from select international markets accessed through brokers like Gallagher and Aon. These products are typically structured as standalone disease covers with specific trigger definitions, waiting periods, and significant sub-limits. They are not cheap, but for large gold kiwifruit operations they can provide meaningful protection.

## Weather Events: The Bigger Annual Risk

While PSA grabs headlines, weather remains the most consistent annual threat to kiwifruit orchards in the Bay of Plenty and other growing regions:

### Hailstorms

Hailstorm damage is the single most commonly claimed weather event across NZ's kiwifruit sector. A hailstorm at flowering — typically September to October — can shred petals and prevent fruit set. Hail during vine growth scars the developing fruit, rendering it unfit for Zespri's fresh market export grades even if the fruit is otherwise healthy.

Hail netting provides meaningful physical protection but is itself an expensive asset — installation costs typically run $30,000–$80,000 per hectare depending on system type and terrain. The netting itself must be insured, and hail events can cause significant net damage that requires repair or replacement before the following season.

### Late Frosts

Frosts in the Bay of Plenty are infrequent by NZ standards, but when they occur during budburst or flowering they can destroy 80–100% of a crop in a single night. The risk is particularly acute in lower-lying orchard sites where cold air pools overnight. Active frost protection — helicopter contracts, sprinkler systems — is common on the most frost-exposed Bay of Plenty sites.

### Cyclone and Wind Events

Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 caused significant damage to Bay of Plenty kiwifruit orchards. Wind damage to infrastructure — hail nets, trellis wires, packing sheds — was widespread, and some low-lying orchards suffered flood and silt damage. This event reinforced the importance of ensuring that cyclone and windstorm perils are explicitly included in your kiwifruit insurance programme, and that sum insured values include all infrastructure at replacement cost.

### Waterlogging and Flooding

Kiwifruit vines are highly sensitive to waterlogged soils. Extended flooding can cause vine death that is not immediately apparent — the visible damage may only emerge weeks after the water recedes. Policies need to be clear about the timing of damage assessment for flood events to ensure valid claims are not declined on a technicality.

## What a Good Kiwifruit Policy Looks Like

A comprehensive kiwifruit orchard insurance programme typically includes:

1. **Standing crop cover** — hail, frost, wind, fire, flood. The core of any kiwifruit policy.
2. **Orchard infrastructure** — hail nets, irrigation systems, trellis, packing shed. Often held under a separate farm or commercial property policy but should be coordinated with crop cover.
3. **Business interruption** — loss of orchard income during recovery from a covered event. Critical for events that damage the vine itself rather than just the current season's crop.
4. **Post-harvest quality cover** — losses from cool store failures, temperature excursions, or handling failures after harvest. Complements crop cover for the post-harvest period.
5. **Public and product liability** — essential for any commercial operation with employees, contractors, or visitors on-site, and for product liability exposure.

## Understanding Zespri Quality Standards and Their Insurance Implications

Kiwifruit insurance claims are assessed against Zespri's grading standards for the relevant variety. A key point for growers: the difference between Class 1 (export grade) and Class 2 or processing-grade kiwifruit is the difference between $8/tray and $1–2/tray. Hail-scarred fruit that cannot meet Class 1 standards creates a significant revenue loss even if 100% of the physical crop is harvested.

Your insurance policy should be structured to compensate for this downgrade — not just physical crop loss. Discuss how the policy handles quality downgrade losses with your broker before you purchase.

## Getting a Quote

Given the complexity of kiwifruit insurance — with its combination of disease risk, high infrastructure value, post-harvest exposure, and Zespri grading standards — we strongly recommend working with a specialist horticulture insurance broker.

    content: `## Why Frost Is the Biggest Single Risk for NZ Vine Growers

A severe frost event during budburst — typically August to October in NZ — can destroy 90%+ of a vineyard's annual crop in a single night. Marlborough, which produces roughly 70% of all NZ wine, and Hawke's Bay, the country's second-largest wine region, both experience frost events capable of causing tens of millions of dollars in crop losses across a region in a single night.

In Marlborough's Wairau and Awatere valleys, September frosts are a near-annual occurrence on lower-lying sites. In Hawke's Bay, late spring frosts in October can catch growers off-guard when vines are already advanced. Martinborough and Central Otago face similar risks, with the added vulnerability of later frosts at high altitude.

## How Vineyard Frost Insurance Works

Vineyard frost insurance operates on a named perils basis: the policy pays out when frost — defined as temperatures below a specified threshold, typically 0°C or -2°C at canopy level — occurs during the defined frost risk period and causes measurable crop loss.

### Temperature Thresholds and Measurement

The threshold temperature at which your policy triggers is one of the most important policy terms to scrutinise. A policy that triggers at 0°C provides broader cover than one triggering at -2°C, but will be more expensive. Key questions to ask:

- At what temperature threshold does the policy trigger?
- How is canopy temperature measured — your own on-site sensor, the nearest NIWA weather station, or an independent mobile unit installed at the vineyard?
- Who is responsible for maintaining and calibrating the measurement equipment?
- What happens if the measurement system fails during a frost event?

### Loss Assessment Methodology

Following a frost, the full extent of crop loss often only becomes clear over 2–4 weeks as damaged tissue dies back and surviving buds develop. This creates a challenge for insurers who want to assess claims quickly.

A well-structured vineyard frost policy will:
- Allow for a post-frost assessment period before final crop loss is confirmed
- Use industry-standard assessment methods (bud count surveys, shoot development assessment)
- Appoint assessors with specific viticulture expertise — not generic agricultural loss adjusters
- Consider the vineyard's specific variety, training system, and yield history in the assessment

### Season-End vs. Event-by-Event Settlement

Some policies settle frost claims event-by-event: each identifiable frost event triggers a separate assessment and payment. Others accumulate across the season and settle on a season-end basis against the grower's historical average yield. The season-end approach better captures the compound effect of multiple smaller frosts and is generally preferable for growers.

## Parametric Vineyard Insurance: A Faster Alternative

An emerging alternative to traditional indemnity insurance is parametric frost cover, available through specialist brokers like Gallagher and Aon. Parametric frost cover pays a predetermined amount — based on your insured value — when temperatures fall below a trigger threshold at a specified weather station. No crop inspection or loss assessment is needed.

**Advantages of parametric cover:**
- Claims payment within days or weeks rather than months
- No disputes about the extent of crop loss
- Lower administration cost
- Predictable payout amount for planning purposes

**Limitations:**
- The payment is fixed regardless of actual crop loss — so if actual losses are higher than the parametric payout, you bear the difference
- Basis risk: the weather station may not perfectly represent conditions in every block of your vineyard
- Not available for all regions or all perils

For many Marlborough growers, a hybrid approach — parametric frost cover combined with traditional indemnity cover for hail and other perils — provides the best balance.

## Active Frost Protection and Its Insurance Implications

Many NZ vineyards invest in active frost protection systems to mitigate risk. Common approaches include:

- **Wind machines / frost fans**: Effective for inversions where warm air exists above the frost layer. Recognised by insurers.
- **Overhead irrigation**: Cold water releases latent heat to protect developing buds. Effective but water-intensive.
- **Helicopter work**: On-call helicopter contractors can mix warm and cold air layers during frost events. Often the most cost-effective for smaller vineyards.
- **Smudge pots / heaters**: Less common in modern NZ viticulture due to cost and labour.

Insurers — particularly FMG and Gallagher — will typically offer premium discounts for vineyards with documented, maintained active frost protection systems. Keep records of your frost protection equipment, maintenance, and any activation during the season, as these may be relevant to your claim or premium.

## Other Key Vineyard Perils

Beyond frost, a comprehensive vineyard policy should cover:

**Hail** — damage at berry development (typically November through February in NZ) is the second most common vineyard loss event. Hailstones can puncture grape skins, leading to rapid botrytis infection and complete loss of affected bunches. A single hailstorm lasting 10 minutes can destroy an entire block.

**Wind damage** — strong winds can damage trellis wires, snap canes, and strip leaves, affecting fruit quality even where physical berry damage is limited. Marlborough and Hawke's Bay both experience significant wind events.

**Smoke taint** — a growing risk in NZ as wildfire frequency increases. Smoke compounds absorbed by grape skins can render wine unpalatable even when fruit shows no physical damage. Smoke taint cover is available from some specialist underwriters.

**Winery infrastructure** — tanks, oak barrels, processing equipment, and winery buildings represent significant capital investment that should be covered separately under a commercial property policy, coordinated with your vineyard crop insurance.

## Cost of Vineyard Insurance in NZ in 2026

Vineyard insurance premiums vary significantly based on variety, region, frost risk profile, and coverage scope. As a guide:

- Small vineyard (under 10 ha): $2,000 – $6,000/year for basic named perils cover
- Medium vineyard (10–30 ha): $6,000 – $18,000/year
- Large Marlborough operation (30+ ha): $18,000 – $45,000+/year

A Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc vineyard on a known frost-prone site in the Wairau Valley floor will pay a materially higher premium than a sheltered mid-slope Hawke's Bay site. Premiums in Marlborough have risen 20–35% over the past three seasons following a combination of frost events and global reinsurance cost increases.

    content: `## The Two Main Types of Crop Insurance

New Zealand growers have access to two fundamentally different types of crop insurance, and choosing between them is one of the most important decisions in structuring your risk management programme. Understanding how each works — and where their limitations lie — is essential before your next renewal.

## Named Perils Insurance: How It Works

Named perils insurance covers specific events that are explicitly listed in the policy. If your crop is damaged or destroyed by a listed peril, you can claim. If the cause of loss is not listed, you cannot — regardless of how severe the damage is.

Common named perils in NZ crop insurance policies include:

- **Hail** — the most commonly claimed peril for horticulture growers
- **Frost** — critical for orchards, vineyards, and vegetable growers
- **Fire** — important for arable crops especially at harvest time
- **Wind / Windstorm** — including cyclone and ex-tropical low events
- **Flood / Excess Moisture** — coverage varies widely; some policies include, others exclude
- **Lightning** — less common but included in most base policies
- **Snow / Ice** — relevant in South Island alpine areas

### What Named Perils Policies Typically Exclude

Understanding the exclusions is just as important as understanding what is covered. Standard named perils exclusions in NZ crop insurance include:

- **Drought** — considered a gradual deterioration rather than a sudden event; almost universally excluded from named perils policies
- **Disease and pest damage** — biological losses are typically excluded
- **Market price decline** — a drop in commodity prices is not an insurable event
- **Poor farming practice** — damage attributable to substandard agronomic management will be declined
- **Pre-existing conditions** — damage present before the policy commenced

### Advantages of Named Perils Cover

**Lower premiums** — because the coverage scope is defined and limited, named perils policies are significantly cheaper than all-risk alternatives. For many NZ growers, this is the deciding factor.

**Simplicity** — both the grower and the insurer know exactly what is and isn't covered. This clarity reduces disputes at claim time.

**Wide availability** — named perils cover is available from multiple NZ insurers including FMG, Gallagher, Aon, and Farmcover. Competition keeps pricing reasonable.

**Tailored peril selection** — some insurers allow growers to select only the perils that are genuinely relevant to their operation, reducing premium cost.

## Multi-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI): How It Works

MPCI provides an all-risks guarantee: you are covered for crop loss from any natural cause, subject to defined exclusions. Rather than listing what is covered, the policy specifies what is NOT covered — and everything else is included.

MPCI policies typically work by guaranteeing a minimum yield or revenue. For example, a policy might guarantee 75% of your historical average yield. If your actual yield falls below 75% of your historical average due to any natural cause, the shortfall is paid by the insurer. This structure provides income certainty that named perils cover cannot match.

### How MPCI Is Structured in NZ

MPCI is less commonly available in New Zealand than in markets like the United States (where it is government-subsidised) or Australia. However, it is accessible through specialist brokers including Gallagher and Aon, who access international underwriting capacity through Lloyd's of London and specialist agricultural underwriters.

Key MPCI policy variables include:

- **Coverage level**: The percentage of historical average yield guaranteed, typically 60–85%
- **Approved yield**: The historical yield record used to calculate your guarantee, usually a 5–10 year Olympic average (excluding highest and lowest years)
- **Price election**: The crop price used to calculate the revenue guarantee — fixed at policy inception or indexed to a market price
- **Individual vs. area trigger**: Some MPCI products trigger on individual farm outcomes; others on area-wide yield data

### Advantages of MPCI

**Drought coverage** — arguably the single biggest advantage of MPCI over named perils for NZ growers, particularly in drier regions like Canterbury and Hawke's Bay. Drought is the most underinsured major agricultural risk in NZ.

**Comprehensive protection** — regardless of what combination of events causes your crop to fail, MPCI provides a safety net. This is particularly valuable for years when multiple smaller events compound to create a significant total loss.

**Revenue certainty** — for growers with supply contracts, debt obligations, or cash flow commitments, MPCI provides income certainty that supports business planning and banking relationships.

**Covers unforeseen risks** — new pests, unusual disease pressures, or novel weather patterns that might not be named perils are covered under all-risk MPCI.

### Limitations of MPCI

**Higher premiums** — MPCI premiums are typically 2–4x higher than equivalent named perils cover. For smaller operations, this cost may not be justified.

**Complexity** — MPCI policies are more complex to understand and administer. The yield guarantee and settlement calculation require good record-keeping.

**Limited NZ availability** — MPCI is not available from all NZ insurers. Accessing it typically requires a specialist broker with international market connections.

**Higher excess** — MPCI policies typically have a built-in deductible equivalent to the uninsured yield band (e.g., the first 25% of yield loss if you insure at 75%).

## A Framework for Choosing Between Named Perils and MPCI

Consider MPCI if:
- You grow high-value crops with large per-hectare input costs and significant revenue at stake
- **Drought** is a genuine risk in your region — this is the single most compelling argument for MPCI
- You have supply contracts with significant penalty clauses for under-delivery
- Your operation is large enough (typically $200,000+ in annual crop revenue) to justify the higher premium cost
- You want to provide your bank with income certainty as part of your lending arrangements

Consider Named Perils if:
- Your main risk is a specific, identifiable weather event — hail for orchard growers is the classic example
- Premium cost is a primary consideration and your business can absorb losses from uninsured perils
- You want a simple, transparent policy that is easy to administer and understand
- You are in a region where drought is not a material risk (Bay of Plenty, Nelson)

## The Hybrid Approach

Many of NZ's larger growers use a hybrid structure: named perils cover for the specific high-frequency risks (hail, frost), supplemented by a revenue protection or revenue top-up product for broader income certainty. This approach balances cost and coverage and is worth exploring with a specialist broker.

## Getting the Right Advice

The best approach is to have a frank conversation with a specialist crop insurance broker who can present both options with comparative pricing. Our broker network can access named perils policies from NZ insurers including FMG and Farmcover, and MPCI products from specialist international markets accessed via Gallagher, Aon, and Howden.

    content: `## Why Hail Is the #1 Insured Risk for NZ Orchardists

Hailstorm damage is the single most commonly claimed weather event across NZ's horticultural insurance sector. Unlike frost or wind, which can be partially mitigated with active protection systems, a hailstorm can strike any exposed orchard with virtually no warning — and the damage is often irreversible.

A hailstone the size of a marble can leave permanent surface scarring on kiwifruit, apples, or stone fruit that renders the crop unfit for premium fresh-market export — even if the fruit itself is otherwise healthy. For export-dependent NZ orchardists, the difference between unblemished Class 1 fruit and hail-scarred Class 2 or processing-grade produce can mean a price cut of 60–80% per tray. The financial impact of a single hailstorm can be devastating.

## How Hail Damage Affects Different Crops

### Kiwifruit

Hail at flowering (typically September–October) can shred petals and prevent fruit set, causing total crop loss in affected blocks. Hail during the growing season scars the developing skin of kiwifruit. Even small scars that would not affect eating quality can fail Zespri's strict export grading standards. A moderate hailstorm can downgrade 40–80% of a block's crop from export grade to processing grade. Because processing prices are a fraction of export prices, the financial loss can be equivalent to a near-total crop failure even where physical damage appears moderate.

### Apples and Pears

Surface scarring is the primary damage mechanism for pip fruit. Class 1 export-grade apples must be essentially blemish-free for premium markets in Asia and Europe. Hail-damaged apples are downgraded to juice or processing grade, typically at a price reduction of 50–70%. For Nelson and Hawke's Bay apple growers shipping premium product to Japan or the UK, even minor hail damage has major financial consequences.

### Grapes

Hail at berry development — typically November through February in NZ — can puncture grape skins, creating entry points for botrytis (grey rot) and other fungal infections. In severe events, bunches may be shattered entirely. The secondary botrytis infection following hail can spread rapidly through a block, leading to complete loss of affected areas. A single hail event can destroy an entire vintage for an affected vineyard.

### Stone Fruit

Cherries are the most vulnerable stone fruit to hail damage. The thin skin of a cherry is easily punctured or split by even small hailstones, and subsequent infection renders the fruit unmarketable. Cherry growers in Central Otago and Hawke's Bay who grow for the premium export market face significant hail exposure during the relatively short harvest window (December–January). Peaches and nectarines are similarly vulnerable during fruit development.

## Hail Cover vs. Hail Nets: Do You Need Both?

Hail netting systems — either permanent over-row structures or moveable systems — are now standard in many of NZ's premium apple and kiwifruit orchards. Nelson apple orchards are among the most heavily netted in NZ, driven by the region's hail risk profile. However, hail nets and hail insurance serve different and complementary roles:

**What hail nets protect:** The crop under the net from direct hail impact. An effective netting system can reduce direct hail damage to covered crop by 70–95%.

**What hail nets do NOT protect:** The net structure itself (which can suffer significant damage in a severe hail event), flowering crops exposed during the brief pollination window, orchard infrastructure, and produce in storage or transit.

**Why you still need hail insurance even with nets:**
- Hail nets themselves cost $30,000–$80,000+ per hectare to install and must be insured at replacement cost
- Severe hail events can damage or destroy nets even where fruit damage is minimised
- Insurers offer significant premium discounts for netted orchards — typically 25–50% — so the combination of physical protection and insurance is economically efficient

## What to Look For in a Hail Policy

### Assessment Methodology

The speed and quality of post-hail loss assessment is one of the most important practical factors in hail insurance. Look for:

- **48-hour response commitment**: Insurers should commit to dispatching a loss adjuster within 48 hours of notification. For fresh fruit, delayed assessment means ongoing quality deterioration that can complicate claim settlement.
- **Specialist assessors**: Loss adjusters for horticultural hail claims should have specific experience with the crop type — kiwifruit grading, pip fruit export standards, cherry harvest timing.
- **Grading standard alignment**: Does the assessment use your actual export market's grading standards? A policy that pays based on generic horticultural grades rather than your specific market's standards may not adequately compensate you.

### Partial Loss Provisions

Most hail events cause partial rather than total crop loss — some blocks may be severely damaged while adjacent blocks escape. Your policy should clearly specify:

- How partial losses across different blocks are assessed and aggregated
- Whether a minimum damage threshold (e.g., 10% of total insured crop) must be reached before a claim can be lodged
- How quality downgrade (rather than physical loss) is assessed and valued

### Infrastructure Coverage

Ensure your policy or a separate farm property policy covers:

- Hail netting structure (poles, wires, net material) at full replacement cost
- Irrigation equipment potentially damaged by hail
- Packing shed roofing and equipment

### Timing Your Cover

Hail insurance must be in place before a hail event occurs. Most insurers want policies renewed and in place by late July or August for the coming NZ growing season. Attempting to insure after a hail warning has been issued will result in a declined application — and attempting to add cover during a season where hail has already occurred will face significant restrictions.

## Premium Factors for Hail Insurance

Your hail premium is influenced by:

- **Crop type and value**: High-value export crops attract higher premiums in dollar terms
- **Region and microclimate**: Areas with higher historical hail frequency (parts of Hawke's Bay, Nelson, Canterbury foothills) attract higher rates
- **Hail netting**: Orchards with certified hail netting can receive discounts of 25–50%
- **Sum insured**: Based on expected yield at market value or at a conservative export price
- **Claims history**: Recent hail claims will increase your premium at renewal
- **Excess level**: A higher per-event excess reduces your annual premium cost

## The Claims Process After a Hailstorm

1. **Notify your broker immediately** — within 24 hours of discovering hail damage
2. **Document everything** — photographs from multiple angles, close-ups of individual fruit damage and wide shots of affected blocks
3. **Do not harvest or remediate** without insurer approval — the adjuster needs to see undisturbed damage
4. **Record weather event details** — time, duration, estimated hailstone size
5. **Prepare yield and grading records** — your historical yield and export grade records will be central to the claim calculation

## Getting a Hail Insurance Quote

Our specialist brokers can approach FMG, Gallagher, Aon, Farmcover, and other relevant markets to find the most competitive hail cover for your orchard.

    content: `## The Changing Face of Weather Risk in NZ Agriculture

New Zealand's agricultural sector is experiencing an intensification of weather-related risks that is directly and materially impacting crop insurance markets. The evidence is not subtle: Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 caused an estimated $14.5 billion in total damage across Hawke's Bay and Tairāwhiti, including catastrophic losses for the region's horticulture and viticulture industries. Orchards were buried in silt, crops destroyed, vine rows washed away, and infrastructure rendered unusable for an entire season.

This single event was a watershed moment for NZ crop insurers. But Gabrielle was not an isolated incident. It followed a period of elevated weather event frequency across NZ agriculture — from unprecedented frosts in Central Otago and Marlborough to severe drought conditions in Canterbury and Hawke's Bay, and from multiple hailstorm seasons to increasing wind event severity. The cumulative effect is a fundamentally repriced crop insurance market.

## How Climate Change Drives Premium Increases

### The Global Reinsurance Cascade

Most NZ crop insurers do not bear all the risk they write — they pass a significant portion to global reinsurers such as Munich Re, Swiss Re, and Hannover Re. These reinsurers aggregate risk globally and price their capacity based on global loss trends. When catastrophic losses increase globally — as they have done consistently over the past decade — reinsurance costs rise. Those cost increases are passed directly through to the NZ domestic market via higher direct insurance premiums.

NZ is a small market with limited negotiating power in global reinsurance. When the global market hardens, NZ growers feel the effects disproportionately. The 2023–2025 reinsurance renewal cycle saw some of the sharpest cost increases since the Christchurch earthquake era.

### Increased Loss Frequency in NZ

Beyond global reinsurance dynamics, NZ's own loss experience has deteriorated. The key measurable trends affecting NZ crop insurance include:

**Rising cyclone and tropical low frequency**: Climate modelling consistently suggests increased frequency of ex-tropical systems affecting NZ, particularly in the northern North Island. For Bay of Plenty kiwifruit, Northland avocado, and Hawke's Bay horticulture growers, this represents a genuine step-change in risk.

**Shifting frost risk patterns**: Counterintuitively, climate change does not mean the end of frost risk — warming trends can destabilise traditional frost patterns, leading to more unpredictable late frosts catching vines and orchards during advanced growth stages. Marlborough viticulture growers have reported that frost timing is harder to predict than it was two decades ago.

**Drought intensification in Canterbury and Hawke's Bay**: Drier summers in Canterbury and more severe drought years in Hawke's Bay are well-documented trends. For arable and vegetable growers, this increases the relevance of multi-peril or drought-inclusive cover products.

**Hailstorm pattern changes**: While the overall frequency of hailstorms has not clearly increased, storm intensity has in some regions. Large hailstone events — capable of damaging hail netting as well as fruit — appear more common in parts of the South Island and Bay of Plenty.

## Premium Trends for NZ Crop Growers: The Numbers

Following Cyclone Gabrielle and a broader period of elevated weather losses, NZ crop insurance premiums have increased materially in many regions and crop sectors:

- **Hawke's Bay horticulture**: Premiums increased 20–40% for the 2023–24 season following Gabrielle. Some flood-exposed sites saw cover withdrawn or terms significantly restricted at renewal.
- **Bay of Plenty kiwifruit**: Cyclone and wind premium loadings increased 15–25%. Flood-exposed lower-lying sites faced tighter terms and higher excesses.
- **Marlborough viticulture**: Frost cover premiums rose 15–30% over the 2022–2026 period as global reinsurance cost increases overlapped with local frost event frequency.
- **Canterbury arable**: Drought-related MPCI products have seen premium increases of 10–20% as drought frequency data is updated in insurer models.
- **Central Otago stone fruit**: Hail and frost premiums rose 15–25%, driven by a combination of global reinsurance costs and local event history.

The picture is not uniformly negative — regions and crop types with better recent loss histories have seen more modest increases, and some specific products have remained relatively stable.

## The Insurance Market Response to Climate Risk

Insurers are not passively absorbing climate-driven losses. The market is adapting through several mechanisms:

**Improved risk modelling**: Insurers are investing in higher-resolution climate and weather modelling to better distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk sites within regions. This means that growers on genuinely lower-risk sites may not see the same premium increases as those on flood plains or frost hollows.

**Withdrawal from highest-risk locations**: Some insurers have declined to renew cover for orchards on proven flood plains or in areas where repeated cyclone damage has occurred. This is a concerning trend for affected growers and underscores the importance of having a broker with access to multiple markets.

**Parametric products**: The insurance market is expanding parametric crop products — which trigger on measurable weather parameters rather than assessed crop losses — as a way of offering faster, more predictable payouts. These products are better suited to the reinsurance market and can provide more stable pricing than traditional indemnity covers.

**Higher excesses and sub-limits**: Insurers are increasingly imposing higher excesses for specific high-frequency perils (e.g., cyclone wind excess of 10% of sum insured) to manage their loss exposure on smaller events.

## What Growers Can Do to Manage Climate-Driven Premium Increases

### Invest in Demonstrable Risk Reduction

The most effective long-term response to premium increases is physical risk mitigation that reduces your actual exposure:

- **Hail netting**: The most proven risk reduction investment for orchardists. Most insurers offer 25–50% premium discounts for certified installations.
- **Drainage improvement**: Demonstrably improving on-farm drainage reduces flood and waterlogging risk and can support better underwriting terms.
- **Frost protection systems**: Active frost protection (wind machines, sprinklers, helicopter contracts) is recognised by insurers and can reduce frost premium loadings.
- **Site selection**: For new plantings, selecting sites away from known frost hollows, flood plains, and cyclone-exposed coastal areas is the most permanent risk management decision.

### Don't Accept Your Renewal at Face Value

In a market where premiums are rising across the board, it is tempting to simply accept renewal terms from your existing insurer to avoid disruption. This is the wrong approach. Premium differences between insurers for the same risk can be 20–40%. Engaging a broker who will approach multiple insurers on your behalf at each renewal is the most reliable way to ensure you are not overpaying.

### Review Your Sum Insured Annually

Rising crop values and input cost inflation mean that sum insured values established two or three years ago may no longer be adequate. Simultaneously, over-insurance is a common and unnecessary cost. An annual sum insured review — guided by current crop value and input cost data — ensures you are paying premium on the right amount.

### Explore Government Risk Management Support

The NZ Government, through the Ministry for Primary Industries, has been exploring options for rural risk management support in the context of climate change. While a government-subsidised crop insurance scheme on the US model does not exist in NZ, MPI's Rural Support Trust network and EQC's natural disaster cover for land provide complementary support for specific situations.

## Looking Ahead

Climate-driven premium increases in NZ crop insurance are unlikely to reverse in the near term. The global reinsurance market is pricing for a world with more frequent and severe weather events, and NZ's own loss history since 2020 provides little argument for premium reductions.

The practical implication is that premium management — through risk reduction investment, active market comparison, and careful policy structuring — becomes as important as any other aspect of your farm business.

    content: `## Do Small Growers Need Crop Insurance?

The short answer: it depends on how much financial impact a crop failure would have on your household and your business. A lifestyle block grower selling occasional produce at a farmers' market is in a very different position from a small commercial vegetable grower with a supermarket supply contract. The relevant question is not the size of your operation — it's the consequence of a bad year.

In NZ's horticulture sector, there is no hard floor below which crop insurance stops making sense. The calculation is straightforward: if a total crop failure would create financial hardship that you could not comfortably absorb from other income or savings, crop insurance is worth investigating.

## The Key Question: What Would a Bad Season Cost You?

Before deciding whether crop insurance is worthwhile, work through this exercise:

1. **What is your expected gross crop revenue this season?** (Market value of your anticipated harvest)
2. **What are your direct input costs?** (Seeds, fertiliser, sprays, labour, contractor costs)
3. **What are your fixed costs associated with the crop?** (Lease costs, irrigation, infrastructure maintenance)
4. **What is your net income from this crop as a proportion of total household income?**

If the answer to questions 1 through 3 totals more than $30,000–$50,000, and if the crop income represents a meaningful share of your household finances, you should be getting a crop insurance quote. The premium may be lower than you expect.

## When It Makes Financial Sense for Small NZ Growers

Crop insurance makes economic sense for smaller operations in several specific circumstances:

**You have supply contracts with minimum delivery obligations.** A supermarket or processor supply agreement often includes financial penalties for under-delivery. If your crop fails without insurance, you not only lose revenue — you may face contractual penalties. This is a compelling case for insurance even on relatively modest operations.

**Your growing season input costs are substantial relative to your resources.** Market gardeners and small orchardists often invest $20,000–$60,000 in a single season's inputs before any revenue is received. Losing this investment to a hailstorm or frost, with no payout, can be business-ending for a small operator.

**You are in a high-risk area for hail or frost.** If your property is in a known frost hollow or a region with significant hail frequency — Nelson, Hawke's Bay, Canterbury foothills — the probability of a loss in any given season is higher. Higher risk makes insurance more relevant.

**Your crop income is a primary household income source.** Lifestyle block growers who have transitioned to small commercial growing, or new entrants establishing their first commercial orchard, often have significant personal financial exposure to a crop failure.

## Options for Smaller Operations

### FMG (Farmers Mutual Group)

FMG will consider smaller horticultural operations and has competitive terms for lifestyle blocks and small orchards with clear commercial intent. FMG's rural adviser network is a genuine advantage for smaller growers — you can have a face-to-face conversation with an adviser who understands NZ farming. FMG typically provides named perils cover (hail, frost, fire, wind) for small operations.

### Farmcover

Farmcover specialises in competitive premiums for smaller farms and can arrange basic named perils cover for market gardens, small orchards, and mixed lifestyle operations. Their products are designed for simplicity, which suits smaller growers who do not want to navigate complex policy documents.

### Package Policies Within Farm Insurance

Rural property and contents policies from FMG and other rural insurers sometimes include limited crop cover as part of a broader farm package. For smaller operations where the crop is one element of a mixed farm, this can be a cost-effective way to get basic protection without a standalone crop policy.

### Howden and Specialist Brokers

For small growers with specific or niche risk profiles — beekeepers, specialist produce growers, high-value herbs — boutique broker access via Howden and similar specialist brokers can sometimes find niche underwriters who offer competitive terms for unusual operations that mainstream insurers are reluctant to quote.

## What Smaller Growers Often Overlook

### Underinsurance Is a Common Problem

Many small growers who do have insurance are significantly underinsured. Common mistakes include:

- Insuring at input cost only, rather than at expected yield value. This leaves the entire profit margin unprotected.
- Failing to update the sum insured when crop values increase or planted area expands.
- Not insuring associated infrastructure — irrigation, small packing sheds, cold stores — alongside the crop.

### The Self-Insurance Trap

Some small growers decide to "self-insure" — effectively treating crop loss as a risk they will absorb from savings or other income. This approach works until it doesn't. A series of average seasons can be absorbed; a catastrophic event that destroys an entire season's crop plus incurs remediation costs cannot be self-insured by most small operators.

The more honest framing of "self-insurance" is "uninsured" — because without a formal risk reserve specifically allocated for crop loss, there is no insurance. There is just hope.

### Timing Matters — Don't Leave It Too Late

Many small growers only think about crop insurance after a weather event has already occurred in their region. At this point, insurers will either decline to quote or will apply significant restrictions. The time to buy crop insurance is well before the risk season opens — for most NZ horticultural crops, this means having cover in place by July or August.

## A Simple Cost-Benefit Framework

Here is a simple way to evaluate whether crop insurance is worth it for your operation:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Annual crop revenue | High — if over $50,000, insure |
| Input cost exposure | High — if over $20,000, insure |
| Supply contract obligations | Very high — almost always insure |
| Risk of frost or hail in your location | High — research local frequency |
| Premium as % of crop value | Should be under 5% for basic cover |

If your operation scores high on multiple factors, the cost of insurance is almost certainly justified.

    content: `## Acting Quickly Is Critical

After a hailstorm, frost, cyclone, or other weather event damages your crop, time is of the essence. Most NZ crop insurance policies require notification within 24–48 hours of discovering damage. Delayed notification can prejudice your claim — and for fresh produce, deteriorating crop quality makes accurate loss assessment harder with every passing day.

This guide walks through the crop insurance claims process for NZ growers, from the moment you discover damage to final settlement.

## Before a Weather Event: Preparation That Makes Claims Easier

The best time to prepare for a crop insurance claim is before any damage occurs. Growers who maintain good records make better claims — and receive fairer settlements.

**Keep current records of:**
- Planted area by block, variety, and expected yield
- Input costs incurred to date each season (spray diaries, fertiliser records, contractor invoices)
- Historical yield data for at least five seasons — this is often the reference point for loss calculation
- Infrastructure values — replacement cost of hail nets, irrigation, buildings
- Any recent crop assessments or grading records

Having this documentation ready means you are not scrambling to find records in the aftermath of a damaging event.

## Step 1: Notify Your Broker or Insurer Immediately

As soon as you identify crop damage that may be covered by your policy, contact your broker or insurer. Do not wait until you have fully assessed the damage yourself — early notification protects your rights under the policy.

When you notify, be ready to provide:
- Your policy number
- The date and approximate time of the weather event
- A brief description of what happened and what damage is visible
- The crops and areas affected
- Whether any immediate action is needed to prevent further damage

If you have a broker, call them first — your broker should manage the notification and claim process on your behalf and can advise on any immediate steps you need to take.

## Step 2: Document Everything Before Touching the Crop

Before harvesting, treating, or otherwise disturbing the damaged crop:

**Photograph damage thoroughly:**
- Wide-angle shots of affected blocks showing the extent of damage
- Close-up shots of individual fruit or plant damage showing the nature of the damage (hail scarring, frost blackening, wind damage, etc.)
- Comparison shots of undamaged crop in adjacent areas if available
- Any visible weather indicators — hailstones on the ground, frost on leaves, wind-damaged infrastructure

**Record the event:**
- Date, time, and duration of the weather event
- Estimated hailstone size (if hail), minimum temperature reached (if frost), or wind speed (if storm)
- Area of your property affected
- Any weather bureau data, news reports, or local observations of the event

**Do not clean up or repair without authorisation:**
- Do not remove hail-damaged nets before inspection
- Do not harvest frost-damaged crops before assessment
- Do not remediate flood damage before the adjuster has attended

If you need to undertake emergency work to prevent further damage — for example, covering a damaged packing shed roof — take photographs first and document exactly what was done and why.

## Step 3: Cooperate with the Loss Adjuster

Your insurer will appoint a loss adjuster — typically an independent specialist — to assess the extent of your claim. For horticultural crop claims, a specialist agricultural adjuster should attend, ideally one with experience in your specific crop type.

**What the adjuster will typically do:**
- Physically inspect all affected blocks and areas
- Assess the nature and extent of damage against the policy trigger conditions
- Review your historical yield records to establish a reference baseline
- Assess the grade split of damaged fruit against market standards
- Prepare a formal loss report that will form the basis of the insurer's settlement offer

**Your role during assessment:**
- Make yourself or a knowledgeable farm manager available during the inspection
- Provide access to all affected areas
- Supply historical yield and grading records when requested
- Raise any concerns about the assessment methodology — your broker can assist

## Step 4: Review the Settlement Offer Carefully

Once the adjuster's report is complete, the insurer will make a settlement offer. Do not automatically accept this without reviewing it carefully. Key things to check:

**Is the loss assessment accurate?**
- Does the assessed damaged area match what you observed?
- Is the yield loss calculation based on an appropriate historical yield reference?
- For quality downgrade claims, does the grade split used reflect your actual market standards?

**Are all covered losses included?**
- Has the claim captured all affected blocks?
- Are infrastructure losses (hail nets, irrigation, buildings) included if covered?
- Is business interruption loss included if covered under your policy?

**Is the excess applied correctly?**
- Verify that the excess is being applied correctly per the policy terms

If you disagree with any aspect of the settlement offer, you have the right to dispute it. Your broker should support you through this process.

## Step 5: Understand How Settlement Is Calculated

For named perils crop insurance, settlement is typically calculated as:

**Settlement = (Assessed loss in value) − (Policy excess) − (Any applicable sub-limits)**

The "assessed loss in value" depends on your policy basis:
- **Input cost basis**: Loss is calculated based on direct input costs invested in the lost crop
- **Yield value basis**: Loss is calculated as (insured yield − actual yield) × insured price per unit
- **Market value basis**: Loss is calculated based on the difference between expected market revenue and actual market revenue achieved

Understanding which basis applies to your policy — and whether it will adequately compensate you for the actual financial impact of the loss — is something to clarify with your broker before a claim occurs, not after.

## Tips for a Smooth Claim Process

1. **Know your policy excess before an event** — so there are no surprises when the settlement is calculated
2. **Keep detailed records year-round** — a grower with five years of documented yield records will receive a fairer assessment than one relying on memory
3. **Use your broker as your advocate** — your broker's job is to advocate for you throughout the claims process, not just at renewal
4. **Don't accept a poor settlement** — you have the right to dispute an assessment; a well-documented counter-argument will usually result in a revised offer
5. **Lodge a notification even if you are uncertain** — you can always withdraw a claim, but you cannot reinstate one that was not lodged within the notification window

    content: `## Overview

New Zealand growers have access to several specialist crop insurance providers. The market is served by a mix of NZ-owned rural insurers, global insurance brokers accessing international markets, and specialist agricultural underwriters. Understanding the differences between these providers is essential for any grower making an informed insurance decision.

The three dominant players are FMG (Farmers Mutual Group), Aon NZ, and Gallagher, each with distinct strengths and target markets. Farmcover and Howden round out the market for specific segments.

## FMG — Farmers Mutual Group

**Best for:** NZ farmers and growers wanting a farmer-owned insurer with genuine rural expertise and nationwide face-to-face adviser support.

FMG is New Zealand's largest rural insurer and has been supporting NZ farmers for over 100 years. As a mutual, FMG's profits are retained to benefit policyholders rather than paid to external shareholders. FMG employs over 100 rural advisers throughout New Zealand, providing genuine face-to-face service in farming communities.

**Crop insurance strengths:**
- Named perils cover for arable crops: FMG is the market leader for Canterbury grain crops and NZ horticultural operations — covering hail, frost, fire, and wind
- Strong claims handling reputation backed by significant NZ rural experience
- Farm package policies that integrate crop, livestock, property, and vehicle cover under a single relationship
- Competitive pricing for standard NZ horticultural risk profiles
- Face-to-face rural adviser support in Hawke's Bay, Bay of Plenty, Marlborough, Canterbury, and Otago

**Potential limitations:**
- Primarily NZ domestic market capacity — very large risks or complex structures requiring London market capacity may not be achievable
- MPCI and parametric products are less developed than at global brokers
- Niche or unusual risk profiles may receive less flexible underwriting terms

**Verdict:** FMG should be the first port of call for most NZ growers — particularly those with standard horticulture, arable, or mixed farm risk profiles who value local relationships and NZ-owned service.

## Gallagher NZ

**Best for:** Larger commercial growers needing international market capacity, complex risk structures, or access to parametric and multi-peril products not available in the NZ domestic market.

Gallagher is a global insurance broker with specialist agribusiness teams in NZ and Australia. For large-scale NZ operations — major kiwifruit orchards, large Marlborough vineyards, substantial Canterbury arable operations — Gallagher can access Lloyd's of London and international insurance markets that domestic insurers cannot.

**Crop insurance strengths:**
- Access to Lloyd's of London and specialist international agricultural underwriters
- Parametric crop products — particularly frost and weather-indexed covers for vineyards and orchards
- MPCI solutions for growers wanting all-risk crop income protection
- Agribusiness specialists with specific NZ horticulture expertise
- Capacity for very large individual risk placements

**Potential limitations:**
- Better suited to larger commercial operations — smaller growers may find pricing less competitive than domestic market alternatives
- Global broker overhead reflected in pricing for standard risks
- Less grassroots NZ farming community presence than FMG

**Verdict:** Gallagher is the preferred choice for NZ's largest and most complex crop operations — particularly those seeking MPCI, parametric cover, or very large limits that exceed domestic insurer capacity.

## Aon NZ

**Best for:** Growers who value data-driven risk analytics, sophisticated risk assessment, and global broker market access.

Aon is one of the world's largest insurance brokers and brings genuine data and analytics capability to its NZ agribusiness practice. For vineyard and viticulture growers in particular, Aon has developed strong expertise and can offer risk modelling that helps growers understand and quantify their weather risk exposure.

**Crop insurance strengths:**
- Risk analytics tools that can model weather event probability for specific vineyard or orchard sites
- Strong viticulture insurance expertise — Marlborough and Hawke's Bay vineyard experience
- Global market access comparable to Gallagher
- Trade credit insurance for export-dependent growers

**Potential limitations:**
- Premium pricing typically reflects global broker overhead
- Less focused on small and medium NZ operations
- NZ agribusiness team smaller than the rural adviser networks of domestic specialists

**Verdict:** Aon is a strong option for viticulture operations, large export-focused horticulture businesses, and growers seeking sophisticated risk analytics alongside their insurance placement.

## Farmcover

**Best for:** Smaller farms and lifestyle blocks wanting competitive premiums for straightforward named perils cover.

Farmcover offers no-frills, competitive crop and farm insurance with a focus on smaller NZ farming operations. Simple products mean lower overhead and competitive pricing for straightforward risks.

**Verdict:** Worth considering for lifestyle blocks and smaller commercial operations where basic named perils cover is the primary need and premium cost is a key consideration.

## Howden

**Best for:** Niche and specialist risks that mainstream insurers are reluctant to quote — unusual crops, specialist farming operations, or growers seeking Lloyd's capacity alongside local expertise.

Howden operates as a specialist broker with access to Lloyd's and international markets. They are particularly relevant for growers with non-standard risk profiles that do not fit neatly into standard NZ insurer appetites.

## Our Recommendation

There is no single "best" crop insurer — the right choice depends on your scale, crop type, risk profile, and risk appetite. Our broker network can approach FMG, Gallagher, Aon, Farmcover, Howden, and other relevant markets simultaneously and present you with comparative quotes. Use our quote form to get started — the service is completely free to NZ growers.`,

    content: `## The Growing Cost of Extreme Weather for NZ Growers

New Zealand agriculture has always faced weather risk — but the frequency and severity of extreme events is increasing. Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 caused an estimated $14.5 billion in total damage, with the Hawke's Bay horticulture and viticulture industry among the hardest hit. Orchards were buried in silt, crops destroyed, and infrastructure washed away. Growers without adequate insurance faced total loss.

Understanding what extreme weather cover is available — and where the gaps are — is essential for any NZ grower.

## The Main Extreme Weather Perils and Insurance Coverage

### Cyclone and Wind Damage

Tropical cyclones, ex-tropical lows, and windstorms are covered under most named perils crop insurance policies. The key variables are:

- **Named storm exclusions**: Some older policies exclude named tropical cyclones. Check your policy wording carefully.
- **Infrastructure vs. crop**: Wind damage to structures (packing sheds, irrigation systems, hail nets) may be covered separately under a farm or commercial policy rather than crop cover.
- **Business interruption**: If a cyclone forces you to stop operations for weeks or months, BI cover can be critical — but it is often not included in base crop cover and must be added as an extension.
- **Silt and remediation costs**: Cyclone flooding that deposits silt over orchards creates remediation costs that may not be covered under a standard crop policy.

### Frost Damage

Frost is one of the most commonly claimed weather perils for NZ horticulture growers. Key points:

- **Budburst timing**: For orchards and vineyards, cover must typically be in place before budburst commences. Attempting to insure after a frost warning has been issued will likely result in a declined application.
- **Sub-limits**: Some policies place sub-limits on frost claims — particularly for early season frosts where the full scale of damage may not be evident immediately.
- **Canterbury and Central Otago**: Late spring frosts in October and November can damage stone fruit, pip fruit, and vine crops at their most vulnerable stage. Regional underwriting can affect premium rates significantly.
- **Assessment timing**: The full extent of frost damage to orchards and vineyards often only becomes clear 2–4 weeks after the event — your policy should allow adequate time for the loss to develop before final assessment.

### Hailstorm

Hail is the single biggest insured peril for NZ pip fruit and horticulture growers. A single hailstorm lasting 10 minutes can render an entire orchard's crop commercially unsaleable. Cover considerations:

- **Hail-only vs. named perils**: Some growers opt for hail-only cover as a lower-cost option. This works well if hail is the dominant risk but leaves gaps for other perils.
- **Hail net discounts**: Insurers will typically discount premiums for orchards with certified hail netting in place — this can significantly reduce the cost of cover.
- **Grading and bruising thresholds**: Not all policies pay out at the same damage threshold. Some require a minimum percentage of fruit to be affected before a claim is triggered.

### Drought

Drought is one of the most underinsured risks in NZ agriculture. Standard named perils policies typically do not include drought cover — it is considered a gradual deterioration rather than a sudden, specified event. Options for drought cover:

- **Multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI)**: Available through international underwriters accessed via Gallagher or Aon, MPCI can include drought as a covered peril with a yield guarantee trigger
- **Parametric insurance**: Pays out automatically when a measured rainfall index falls below a defined threshold — no loss assessment required. Increasingly available in NZ through specialist brokers.
- **Irrigation infrastructure**: While drought cover on crop is limited, insuring irrigation infrastructure (pivots, pumping systems, drains) is standard practice

### Flooding and Waterlogging

Post-Gabrielle, flooding has become a heightened concern. Most crop policies will cover flood damage to standing crops. However:

- **Silt damage and remediation costs**: The cost of removing silt from orchards is significant and may not be covered under a crop policy
- **Quality vs. physical damage**: Flood-damaged fruit that cannot be harvested cleanly may result in quality downgrade claims rather than total loss claims, which can affect payout amounts

## Are Premiums Rising Due to Climate Risk?

Yes. Insurers and reinsurers globally are recalibrating their pricing models to reflect increased extreme weather frequency. NZ growers are seeing the effects:

- Hail and wind premiums in exposed regions (Hawke's Bay, Marlborough, Bay of Plenty) have increased by 15–35% over the past four years
- Some insurers have reduced capacity in high-risk postcodes or introduced higher excesses for cyclone perils
- Multi-year claims histories are being weighted more heavily in underwriting decisions

## What to Check Before the Season

Before each growing season, growers should review:

1. Is your sum insured still accurate given changes in crop value or expansion of planted area?
2. Have you updated your broker on any new infrastructure, irrigation, or hail netting installed?
3. Are there any new perils you should be adding cover for?
4. Is your policy in place before any key risk window opens (budburst, flowering, harvest)?
5. Does your policy include business interruption if a catastrophic event could put you out of production for a full season?

Our specialist brokers can run a pre-season policy review at no cost. Contact us to arrange this before your next growing season begins.`,

    content: `## What Drives the Cost of Crop Insurance in NZ?

Crop insurance premiums in New Zealand are calculated based on a combination of factors that reflect the specific risk profile of each growing operation. Understanding these factors helps you anticipate what you might pay — and identify practical ways to reduce your premium.

**Key factors in crop insurance pricing:**

- **Crop type and value per hectare**: High-value crops like kiwifruit, grapes, and stone fruit attract higher premiums in dollar terms than lower-value arable crops, even at similar percentage rates
- **Region and microclimate**: Growers in frost-prone valleys (Central Otago, Marlborough, Hawke's Bay) or cyclone-exposed coastal areas pay more than those in more sheltered locations
- **Coverage type**: Named perils cover is cheaper than multi-peril cover; revenue protection is the most expensive but provides the broadest guarantee
- **Sum insured basis**: Whether you insure at input cost, expected yield value, or market value affects both premium and claims outcome
- **Claims history**: Growers with recent claims will pay more; a clean history over three or more years can earn lower rates
- **Infrastructure**: Hail netting, frost protection systems, and good on-farm biosecurity can all attract underwriting discounts — sometimes substantial ones
- **Deductible/excess**: A higher excess reduces your premium but increases your out-of-pocket exposure on any claim
- **Market access**: Brokers accessing multiple insurers — FMG, Gallagher, Aon, Farmcover, Howden — can find more competitive pricing than going direct to a single insurer

## 2026 Indicative Premium Ranges by Crop

The following are indicative annual premium ranges based on typical NZ commercial operations in 2026. Actual premiums vary based on the factors above. These are guides only.

### Kiwifruit (Gold and Green)
- Small orchard (under 5 ha): $2,500 – $6,000/year
- Medium orchard (5–15 ha): $6,000 – $14,000/year
- Large commercial (15+ ha): $14,000 – $35,000+/year

Named perils cover (hail, frost, wind): approximately 1.5–3.5% of insured value per annum. Gold variety orchards often attract lower rates due to better yield predictability. Bay of Plenty sites with good drainage and active frost protection can sit toward the lower end.

### Apples and Pears
- Small orchard (under 10 ha): $1,800 – $5,000/year
- Medium orchard (10–30 ha): $5,000 – $14,000/year
- Large operation (30+ ha): $14,000 – $30,000+/year

Hail-only cover (most popular for pip fruit growers in Nelson and Hawke's Bay): typically 0.8–2% of insured value. Orchards with certified hail nets installed can see premium discounts of 25–50%.

### Grapes and Vineyards
- Small vineyard (under 10 ha): $2,000 – $6,000/year
- Medium vineyard (10–30 ha): $6,000 – $18,000/year
- Large operation (30+ ha): $18,000 – $45,000+/year

Frost is the dominant premium driver for most Marlborough operations — frost cover can account for 60–70% of total premium cost.

### Wheat, Barley and Arable Grain
- Small arable farm (under 200 ha in crop): $800 – $3,000/year
- Medium farm (200–500 ha): $3,000 – $9,000/year
- Large operation (500+ ha): $9,000 – $20,000+/year

Arable cover is generally the most affordable crop insurance in NZ per hectare. FMG is the primary market for Canterbury arable hail and fire cover.

### Stone Fruit (Cherries, Peaches, Nectarines, Plums)
- Small orchard: $1,500 – $5,000/year
- Commercial orchard: $5,000 – $16,000/year

Cherries attract the highest premiums among stone fruit due to their high value per hectare, vulnerability to rain damage at harvest, and concentrated harvest window.

### Hops
- Small hop garden (under 10 ha): $1,200 – $4,000/year
- Commercial hop garden: $4,000 – $12,000/year

### Vegetables
- Small operation (under 20 ha): $700 – $3,000/year
- Large commercial operation: $3,000 – $12,000/year

## Has the Cost of Crop Insurance Increased Recently?

Yes. NZ crop insurance premiums have trended upward in recent seasons, driven by:

- **Global reinsurance cost increases**: Following major international weather events and Cyclone Gabrielle, reinsurers increased rates, which flows through to direct premium pricing
- **Increased loss frequency in NZ**: Several consecutive seasons with significant weather events have pushed insurer loss ratios higher
- **Input cost inflation**: Higher crop values mean higher sums insured and higher premiums in dollar terms even at the same rate

Typical premium increases in the 2024–2026 period have ranged from 10–30% depending on crop type and region.

## How to Reduce Your Crop Insurance Premium

1. **Install hail netting**: Most insurers offer 25–50% discounts for certified installations — the ongoing premium saving typically contributes to the netting investment payback calculation
2. **Invest in active frost protection**: Wind machines, overhead irrigation frost systems, or helicopter contracts are recognised by insurers and can reduce frost premiums
3. **Choose a higher excess**: Accepting a higher deductible on small claims reduces your premium while maintaining protection against catastrophic loss
4. **Maintain a clean claims history**: A sustained period without claims builds goodwill and can unlock lower rates at renewal
5. **Use a specialist broker**: Market difference can be 20–40% for identical cover — a broker accessing multiple insurers will find the most competitive pricing

    content: `## The Hidden Risk for NZ Export Crop Growers

Growing a successful crop is only half the challenge for New Zealand's export horticulture sector. Getting it off the farm, into cold storage, onto a vessel, and delivered to international markets — at the right quality and on time — is the other half. And increasingly, that journey involves significant risk.

New Zealand's top export crops — kiwifruit, apples, wine, onions, and squash — depend on a global logistics chain that has been under significant pressure. COVID-era disruptions reshaped supply chains, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have added new layers of uncertainty for growers and exporters.

## The Impact of Global Disruption on NZ Crop Export Logistics

### Red Sea and Suez Canal Disruptions

The escalation of attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea from late 2023, and the subsequent rerouting of vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, added 10–14 days to transit times between NZ and European markets. For fresh produce like apples, kiwifruit, and stone fruit, extended transit times directly affect product quality on arrival.

For NZ export growers, the practical impacts included:

- **Increased freight costs**: Cape of Good Hope routing added 25–40% to shipping costs on NZ-Europe routes
- **Cold chain integrity risk**: Longer transit times increase the risk of quality deterioration, particularly for sensitive produce like kiwifruit and cherries
- **Port congestion**: Rerouted vessels created knock-on delays at NZ loading ports

### War Risk in Marine Cargo Policies

Standard marine cargo policies include war exclusion clauses. Vessels transiting through or near conflict zones may void cargo insurance coverage unless a specific war risk extension has been purchased. NZ growers and exporters need to confirm with their insurer or broker that marine cargo cover includes war risk extension where relevant — and understand whether routing through affected regions triggers exclusions.

## What Insurance Covers for Export Crop Growers

### Marine Cargo Insurance

Marine cargo insurance covers physical loss or damage to goods in transit. For NZ export crops this is critical. Key cover areas:

- **Physical damage in transit**: Crushing, contamination, breakage during loading, transit, or unloading
- **Temperature excursion**: Most policies for fresh produce include temperature failure cover for refrigerated containers
- **Vessel general average**: If a vessel incident requires cargo to be jettisoned, marine cargo insurance covers your share of the cost
- **War risk extension**: Covers loss from war, strikes, riots, and civil commotion in transit zones

### What Marine Cargo Does NOT Cover

- Market price decline on arrival not caused by an insured peril
- Customs delays or detention
- Rejection for contractual reasons unrelated to transit damage
- Regulatory import restrictions or market access changes

### The Boundary Between Crop Insurance and Marine Cargo

- **Crop insurance** covers loss or damage while the crop is growing, at harvest, and typically through to delivery to the packhouse or cool store
- **Marine cargo insurance** takes over once the crop leaves the packhouse and enters the logistics chain

Gaps can exist during post-harvest storage and cool store periods — a specialist broker will identify these and ensure continuity of cover.

## Revenue Implications of Logistics Disruption

Beyond direct physical loss, logistics disruption has revenue implications that standard crop insurance does not address:

- Price collapse due to oversupply when delayed shipments arrive in market at the same time as other origins
- Contract penalties for late delivery
- Relationship damage affecting long-term market access

Revenue protection insurance and trade credit insurance are separate products that can partially address these risks.

## What NZ Export Growers Should Do

1. **Review your marine cargo cover annually**: Ensure your policy includes temperature excursion cover and war risk extension where relevant
2. **Confirm there is no coverage gap**: Ensure continuity between crop insurance and marine cargo
3. **Talk to your broker about routing changes**: Routing changes may affect your cover
4. **Consider revenue protection**: For export-dependent operations, revenue protection provides a safety net against price and volume shortfalls
5. **Keep records of logistics costs**: Documentation of freight costs, cold chain records, and delivery timelines will be critical in any transit claim

    content: `## The Premium Pressure NZ Growers Are Feeling

If your crop insurance renewal has come in noticeably higher than last year, you are not alone. Across New Zealand's horticulture and arable sectors, premiums have risen materially over the 2023–2026 period. Understanding why this is happening — and what you can realistically do about it — is the first step to managing your insurance costs effectively.

## The Four Main Drivers of Rising Crop Insurance Premiums

### 1. Global Reinsurance Hardening

Most NZ crop insurers pass a significant portion of their risk to global reinsurers — large international firms like Munich Re, Swiss Re, and Lloyd's syndicates that take on the tail risk of catastrophic events. Following a series of major global natural disasters across 2020–2024, the global reinsurance market hardened sharply. New Zealand, as a small market at the edge of the Pacific, has limited negotiating power. Reinsurance cost increases flow directly into local premium rates.

### 2. Cyclone Gabrielle and the NZ Claims Environment

Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 was the costliest natural disaster in NZ history. Agricultural losses in Hawke's Bay — across kiwifruit orchards, apple and pear operations, vegetable growing districts, and livestock — pushed insured agricultural losses to record levels in a single event. Insurer loss ratios deteriorated significantly, and premium adjustments followed at the next renewal cycle.

The impact was not confined to Hawke's Bay. Across the NZ market, insurers repriced wind and flood perils in response to Gabrielle's demonstration that NZ cyclone events can be far more severe than previously modelled.

### 3. Higher Crop Values Driving Higher Premiums in Dollar Terms

Even where premium rates as a percentage of insured value have remained stable, higher crop values — driven by rising commodity prices, export demand, and input cost inflation — mean higher premiums in dollar terms. Kiwifruit orchard valuations, vineyard land values, and per-hectare revenue for top-quality apple operations have all increased materially since 2020.

### 4. Increased Frequency of Smaller Events

Beyond Gabrielle, NZ growers have experienced above-average frequency of smaller weather events — frosts, hailstorms, and wind events — in recent seasons. These smaller, more frequent claims have pushed insurer combined ratios higher, prompting broad-based premium adjustments.

## What Growers Can Do to Manage Rising Premiums

### Don't Automatically Renew — Compare the Market

The most costly mistake growers make at renewal is accepting the incumbent insurer's offer without testing the market. Premiums for the same coverage can vary by 20–40% between insurers for the same risk profile. A specialist broker can do this comparison at no cost.

### Review Your Sum Insured

Over-insurance is surprisingly common. If your insured value has not been reviewed in two or three years, it may not reflect current conditions. An accurate sum insured means you pay premium only on the risk you actually carry.

### Invest in Physical Risk Reduction

- **Hail netting**: Premium discounts of 25–50% are available from most insurers for certified installations
- **Active frost protection**: Wind machines, helicopter contracts, or overhead irrigation frost systems are recognised by underwriters
- **Drainage improvement**: Demonstrably better drainage reduces flood risk and can support better underwriting terms
- **Biosecurity protocols**: For disease-sensitive crops, demonstrable biosecurity investment can support lower loadings

### Consider a Higher Excess

Accepting a higher deductible reduces your premium while maintaining protection against losses that would genuinely threaten your business. Review whether your current excess reflects your actual capacity to absorb smaller events.

### Consolidate Your Cover with One Broker

Growers with farm insurance, crop, vehicle, and marine cargo cover spread across multiple brokers miss opportunities for portfolio discounts. A single broker managing your full agricultural insurance portfolio is better positioned to negotiate on your behalf.

## Looking Ahead

The global reinsurance market showed some stabilisation in late 2025 as capital returned following strong earnings years. However, NZ-specific factors — including ongoing climate variability and the continuing repricing of cyclone and wind risk — suggest meaningful premium reductions are unlikely in the near term.

Active management of your insurance programme — working with a specialist broker and investing in physical risk reduction — will deliver better outcomes than passive renewal. Our specialist brokers are available for a free, no-obligation review of your current cover. Contact us today.`,

    content: `## The Vegetable Growing Sector in New Zealand

New Zealand's vegetable growing industry supplies both domestic supermarkets and export markets, with key production regions including Pukekohe (South Auckland), Ohakune, Canterbury, and Marlborough. The sector ranges from large-scale outdoor brassica and root vegetable operations to intensive greenhouse production of tomatoes, capsicums, and cucumbers. Each production system faces a distinct set of risks — and requires a tailored crop insurance approach.

The financial exposure in commercial vegetable growing can be substantial. A 50-hectare outdoor vegetable operation may have $500,000–$1,500,000 of crop value in the ground at any point during the season, with significant seasonal input costs invested before any revenue is received. A single hailstorm, flood, or late frost can wipe out an entire season's investment.

## Key Risks for NZ Vegetable Growers

### Outdoor Vegetable Production

**Hail** is the primary catastrophic risk for outdoor vegetable growers. Leafy vegetables, brassicas, and salad crops are particularly vulnerable — a hailstorm can shred leaves and stems beyond recovery, rendering the entire crop unsaleable. Root vegetables are more resilient to physical hail damage but remain exposed at transplanting and early growth stages.

**Frost** is critical for warm-season crops — tomatoes, courgettes, capsicums, beans, and sweet corn — that cannot tolerate even brief temperature dips below 0°C. Spring planting decisions are driven partly by frost risk, and a late frost after transplanting can cause total crop failure. For cool-season crops (brassicas, root vegetables), frost is less damaging but can still affect quality and marketability.

**Flooding and waterlogging** are significant risks for low-lying Pukekohe and Canterbury vegetable districts. Vegetable crops have shallow root systems and are highly sensitive to waterlogged conditions — a flooded field can lose its entire crop within days. Post-flood soil compaction and erosion can also delay replanting for a full season.

**Wind damage** can shatter plants at transplanting stage, damage irrigation infrastructure, and in severe events flatten entire crops.

**Drought** is a growing concern in Canterbury and parts of the North Island. Vegetable crops are highly water-dependent, and without adequate irrigation a dry summer rapidly translates to crop failure.

### Greenhouse and Protected Cropping

**Structural failure** is the primary risk for greenhouse operations — catastrophic failure from hail, wind, or snow load can destroy the growing infrastructure along with the crops inside. Greenhouse structures must be insured at full replacement cost under a commercial property policy, typically separate from crop cover.

**Equipment and system failure** — heating system failure, ventilation failure, or irrigation system breakdown — can cause rapid crop losses in a controlled environment. Equipment breakdown cover is a relevant extension for greenhouse operators.

**Power outages** can affect heated greenhouses in winter. If the heating system fails during a cold snap, an entire crop can be lost within hours — generator backup and power outage cover are worth considering.

## Insurance Options for Vegetable Growers

### FMG

FMG is well-positioned for outdoor vegetable operations of commercial scale. They offer named perils cover (hail, frost, fire, wind) and have experience with Pukekohe, Canterbury, and Marlborough vegetable growing. FMG's rural adviser network means face-to-face support is available in most vegetable growing regions.

### Gallagher and Specialist Brokers

For larger commercial vegetable operations, or those with complex risk profiles including significant greenhouse assets, Gallagher and specialist brokers can access broader coverage including business interruption, equipment breakdown, and — in some cases — multi-peril crop insurance with drought cover.

### Farmcover

For smaller market gardens and vegetable operations, Farmcover offers competitive basic named perils cover with straightforward policy structures.

## Structuring Your Vegetable Crop Insurance Programme

A well-structured vegetable insurance programme typically includes:

**1. Crop cover (named perils)**
- Covers: hail, frost, fire, wind, flood (confirm flood inclusion — not universal)
- Sum insured: Expected market value of growing crops across all paddocks or greenhouses
- Key point: Ensure the policy covers crops at all growth stages — from transplanting through to harvest

**2. Business interruption**
- Covers: Lost profit if a covered event forces you to stop production
- Critical for growers with supermarket supply contracts or processor arrangements needing continuity of supply

**3. Farm property and infrastructure**
- Covers: Irrigation systems, greenhouses, packing sheds, cold stores, machinery
- Often held separately from crop cover but should be coordinated through the same broker

**4. Public and product liability**
- Public liability: Essential for any operation with employees, contractors, or on-farm visitors
- Product liability: Covers claims arising from contamination or quality issues reaching consumers

## Contract Growers: Special Considerations

Vegetable growers operating under supply contracts with supermarkets or processors face particular insurance pressure. If you have contracted to supply a specific volume of produce, failure to deliver — even due to a natural disaster — may trigger contractual penalties or loss of the supply relationship.

For contract vegetable growers, insurance should be structured to cover:
- The full contracted value of the crop (not just input costs)
- Business interruption during recovery from a covered event
- Contractual obligations — discuss with your broker whether penalty exposure is insurable

## Regional Considerations

**Pukekohe**: Auckland's vegetable bowl faces hail risk, flooding risk in lower-lying areas, and occasional frost. High land values mean the capital cost of crop failure is significant.

**Canterbury**: Outdoor vegetable growers face drought as a primary risk alongside hail and frost. MPCI with drought cover may be relevant for Canterbury operations that are not fully irrigated.

**Marlborough**: Hail and wind are the primary risks. Marlborough's dry, sunny climate favours outdoor vegetable production but creates hail exposure during summer.

**Hawke's Bay**: Post-Gabrielle, flood cover is an important inclusion for growers on the Heretaunga Plains. Ensure your policy explicitly includes flood and that the sum insured reflects current crop values.

## Getting a Quote for Your Vegetable Operation

Every vegetable growing operation has a different risk profile — crop mix, production system, region, and scale all affect what insurance you need and what it will cost.

    content: `## The Rise of NZ Avocado Production

New Zealand has become one of the Southern Hemisphere's notable avocado producers, with the industry centred in Northland, the Bay of Plenty, and the Coromandel. NZ Avocado — the industry grower cooperative — estimates planted area has grown significantly over the past decade, driven by strong export demand and the premium prices achieved in Australian and Asian markets.

Avocado orchards represent substantial capital investment. Establishment costs for a commercial avocado orchard run to $40,000–$80,000 per hectare when land preparation, trees, irrigation, and establishment costs are included. The trees take 3–5 years to reach commercial production, creating a long capital recovery horizon. This level of investment makes robust insurance cover not just advisable but essential.

## Key Risks Facing NZ Avocado Growers

### Cyclone and Wind Damage

Wind is the primary catastrophic risk for avocado orchards in Northland and the Bay of Plenty. Avocado trees are large, brittle-branching trees highly vulnerable to wind damage. Strong winds can:

- Strip fruit from trees, causing total crop loss
- Snap major limbs, setting back production for 2–3 years while the tree recovers
- Uproot young trees in soft soils, causing complete re-establishment losses
- Damage windbreak infrastructure, reducing protection for subsequent seasons

Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 caused significant wind damage to Bay of Plenty avocado orchards, and tropical cyclone remnants regularly affect Northland. Any avocado insurance programme must include cyclone and windstorm perils as a core cover. Specifically check that your policy does not exclude named tropical cyclones — some older policy wordings do.

### Frost Risk

While Northland is warm enough to grow avocados commercially, frost events do occur and can be devastating. Young trees are particularly frost-sensitive. A frost at flowering — typically July to September — can damage or destroy an entire season's fruit set.

The Bay of Plenty has a more moderate frost risk than Northland for most sites, but lower-lying orchards are exposed. Central and southern North Island avocado plantings are subject to higher frost risk, and insurance terms may reflect this.

### Hailstorm Damage

Hail can cause significant cosmetic damage to avocado skin, downgrading fruit from Class 1 export grade to domestic or processing grade. Given that export-grade NZ avocados achieve significant price premiums over domestic-grade fruit, even partial hail damage has material financial consequences.

### Root Rot — Phytophthora cinnamomi

Phytophthora root rot is the most significant ongoing disease threat to NZ avocado orchards. The disease thrives in waterlogged soils and can kill mature trees. While disease cover is generally excluded from standard named perils policies, growers should discuss with their broker whether any disease cover or business interruption extensions are available.

Waterlogging that precedes or accelerates root rot may be coverable as a flood or excess moisture event even where the root rot itself is not.

## What a Good Avocado Orchard Insurance Programme Looks Like

### Standing Crop Cover

The core of avocado insurance should cover:
- **Named perils**: Cyclone/wind, hail, frost, fire, flood
- **Sum insured**: Based on expected yield value at current market prices — NZ export-grade avocados have achieved strong prices and this should be reflected in your sum insured
- **Seasonal timing**: Avocado harvest runs approximately September to February depending on variety and region. Ensure your policy covers the full risk period.

### Orchard Infrastructure

Avocado orchards often have significant infrastructure investment:
- **Irrigation systems**: Essential for production and frost protection
- **Windbreaks**: Casuarina or macrocarpa shelter belts are a significant asset and should be insured
- **Packing facilities**: Orchards with on-site packing and cool storage facilities need commercial property cover for these assets

### Business Interruption

If cyclone damage to limbs or roots affects your orchard's production capacity for one or more seasons beyond the immediate season of loss, business interruption cover can compensate for the extended income loss. This is particularly relevant for avocados given the multi-season impact of major wind damage.

## Insurance Providers for Avocado Growers

### FMG

FMG is the primary insurer for NZ avocado orchards through their horticulture programme. Their Northland and Bay of Plenty rural advisers have experience with avocado risk profiles. FMG can provide named perils cover including cyclone, hail, frost, and fire.

### Gallagher

For larger commercial avocado operations, Gallagher can access international market capacity for higher-value risk placements. They are particularly relevant for orchards seeking business interruption cover or higher sum insured limits.

### Aon

Aon's agribusiness practice can service larger avocado operations, particularly those with complex risk profiles or significant infrastructure values alongside crop cover.

## Regional Considerations for NZ Avocado Insurance

**Northland**: The primary NZ avocado growing region. High cyclone exposure — policies must include tropical cyclone cover without named-storm exclusions. Frost risk is lower than further south but not absent. Phytophthora is a perennial concern in heavier Northland soils.

**Bay of Plenty**: Second major region. Cyclone exposure similar to Northland. Moderate frost risk on most sites. Strong export infrastructure via Port of Tauranga.

**Coromandel and Waikato**: Smaller but growing production areas. Higher frost exposure than Northland. Cyclone risk comparable.

## Premium Expectations for Avocado Orchards

Avocado insurance premiums are influenced by location, orchard age, infrastructure quality, and cyclone exposure. As a guide:

- Small orchard (under 5 ha): $2,000 – $5,500/year
- Medium orchard (5–15 ha): $5,500 – $14,000/year
- Large commercial (15+ ha): $14,000 – $30,000+/year

These are indicative ranges — wind/cyclone loading can push premiums higher for exposed Northland coastal sites.

    content: `## Central Otago: World-Class Fruit, Significant Weather Risk

Central Otago is New Zealand's stone fruit heartland. The region's distinctive continental climate — hot summers, cold winters, low rainfall, and extreme diurnal temperature variation — creates exceptional conditions for growing premium cherries, apricots, peaches, nectarines, and plums. Central Otago cherries in particular have built a global reputation for quality, commanding premium prices in Asian export markets that make the region's orchards among the most valuable per-hectare agricultural land in NZ.

But Central Otago's climate that makes it ideal for stone fruit also creates significant weather risk. Late spring frosts, summer hailstorms, and rain at harvest are the three main threats to an industry whose success depends on delivering blemish-free, perfectly timed fresh fruit to demanding export markets.

## The Main Weather Risks for Central Otago Stone Fruit

### Late Spring Frost

Spring frost is the existential risk for Central Otago stone fruit growers. The valley floors — Cromwell, Clyde, Alexandra — that provide the best growing conditions also experience significant temperature inversions on still, clear spring nights. Frost events in October and November, when blossoms are open or fruit is setting, can destroy 80–100% of a crop in a single night.

The timing challenge is acute: stone fruit varieties bloom earlier than other crops, often in September or October, when late frosts remain a real possibility. A warm spell can advance bloom timing, then a subsequent cold front can catch growers by surprise.

Active frost protection is widespread in Central Otago — wind machines, overhead sprinkler systems, and helicopter contracts are common. Insurers recognise these investments with premium discounts, but frost insurance remains essential even on protected sites. No physical protection system is 100% reliable across all frost scenarios.

### Summer Hailstorms

Summer thunderstorms in Central Otago can produce hail that causes significant cosmetic damage to stone fruit — particularly cherries, where skin marking from even small hailstones renders fruit unfit for premium export markets. The narrow harvest window for cherries (typically mid-December to mid-January) means that a hailstorm during this period can cause total loss of the export-grade crop with no opportunity for recovery.

Hail nets are increasingly installed in newer Central Otago cherry orchards, following the model established in apple orchards. However, significant planted area remains unnetted, particularly in older orchards and on steeper terrain where net installation is more difficult.

### Rain at Cherry Harvest

Rain damage at cherry harvest is a risk distinct from hail — it is not an insured peril under standard named perils cover but represents a significant revenue threat. Rain on ripe cherries causes the skin to absorb water rapidly, leading to cracking that renders the fruit unmarketable. Rain-at-harvest events have caused major losses for Central Otago cherry growers in several recent seasons.

Some specialist underwriters can provide rain-at-harvest cover for cherry growers as a standalone product or extension — discuss this with your broker as it addresses a genuine gap in standard named perils policies.

### Wind Damage

Strong nor'west winds across the Central Otago basin can cause significant wind damage to stone fruit orchards — stripping fruit, damaging trellis systems, and in severe events snapping limbs. Wind events during fruit development can cause ground-fall that substantially reduces harvestable yield even where remaining fruit is undamaged.

## Insurance Options for Central Otago Stone Fruit Growers

### Named Perils Cover

The standard approach for most Central Otago stone fruit growers is named perils cover including:

- **Frost**: The non-negotiable peril for spring insurance
- **Hail**: Critical for unnetted orchards and for the harvest window
- **Wind**: For ground-fall and structural damage
- **Fire**: Standard inclusion for all orchard insurance

**FMG** is the most active insurer in Central Otago stone fruit and has specific experience with the region's risk profile. Their Otago/Southland rural advisers understand local frost and hail patterns.

**Gallagher** can access international market capacity for larger operations or those seeking parametric frost products.

### Parametric Frost Cover

Parametric frost insurance — which pays a predetermined amount when temperatures fall below a trigger threshold at a specified weather station — is particularly well-suited to Central Otago frost risk. Cromwell, Alexandra, and Clyde all have reliable weather station coverage. A parametric product provides fast, dispute-free payment following a frost event, which is valuable for growers managing cash flow through a season.

### Rain-at-Harvest Extension

As noted above, rain-at-harvest cover is available from some specialist underwriters and addresses a real gap for cherry growers. Discuss this option with your broker — for orchards growing primarily for export fresh markets, it can be a valuable addition.

## Understanding Cherry Insurance in Detail

Cherries deserve specific focus because their insurance profile is uniquely challenging:

**High value per hectare**: A top-producing Central Otago cherry block can generate $80,000–$150,000/ha in revenue at export prices. This creates a very large insurance exposure per hectare.

**Concentrated harvest window**: The entire season's revenue is generated in 4–6 weeks. A weather event during this window causes disproportionate damage compared to other crops.

**Quality standards are absolute**: Cherry export markets — Japan, Korea, China — have strict grading standards. Any visible damage (hail, marking, cracking) eliminates the premium grade entirely. The step-down from export grade to domestic grade is severe in price terms.

**Frost sensitivity at multiple stages**: Cherries are frost-sensitive at blossom and also at early fruit development. Multiple frost events can compound to cause significant losses even where individual events appear moderate.

## Premium Expectations for Central Otago Stone Fruit

Premium rates for Central Otago stone fruit reflect the region's genuine frost and hail risk. As a guide for 2026:

- Small orchard (under 5 ha, cherries): $3,000 – $8,000/year
- Medium cherry orchard (5–15 ha): $8,000 – $20,000/year
- Large commercial cherry operation: $20,000 – $45,000+/year
- Apricot, peach, nectarine (mid-size orchard): $2,000 – $8,000/year

Frost cover is the largest component of Central Otago stone fruit premiums. Orchards with active frost protection systems receive meaningful discounts.

## Getting the Right Cover for Your Central Otago Orchard

Central Otago stone fruit insurance requires specialist knowledge — both of the region's specific risk profile and of the export market dynamics that determine how losses are valued. Our specialist brokers have experience in the Central Otago market and can approach FMG, Gallagher, Aon, and other relevant underwriters to find the most comprehensive and competitive cover for your operation.

    content: `## New Zealand's Hop Industry

New Zealand is a globally significant hop producer, with the Nelson-Tasman region at the centre of the industry. NZ hops — particularly distinctive varieties like Nelson Sauvin, Riwaka, Motueka, and Pacific Gem — are internationally recognised for their unique flavour profiles, achieving premium prices in export markets and supplying both domestic craft brewers and major international brewing companies.

The NZ hop industry is concentrated in the Waimea Plains (near Nelson), the Moutere Valley (Tasman), and parts of the Wairau Valley in Marlborough. Commercial hop gardens are capital-intensive operations: the infrastructure required — tall poles, wire systems, string lines, irrigation, and drying kilns — represents a significant fixed investment on top of the value of the annual crop itself.

Understanding this dual exposure — both the high-value annual crop and the substantial fixed infrastructure — is essential to structuring appropriate insurance for hop growers.

## Key Risks for NZ Hop Growers

### Hailstorms

Hail is the primary catastrophic weather risk for hop gardens in Nelson-Tasman and Marlborough. The Nelson-Tasman region can experience hailstorms during the growing season (September through to harvest in March–April), and hail damage to hop bines at any stage of development can cause significant crop loss.

Hailstones can shred hop leaves, damage developing cones, and dislodge bines from their string systems. A severe hailstorm during peak growth or shortly before harvest can cause total loss of affected areas. Unlike fruit orchards where hail nets are increasingly standard, hop gardens have traditionally been unnetted — the tall structure (typically 6–7 metres) makes conventional netting impractical.

### Wind Events

Strong winds are a significant risk for hop gardens given their height and the mechanical load on the pole and wire system. Gale-force winds can:

- Blow bines from their string systems, losing the crop for the season
- Damage or destroy the pole and wire infrastructure itself
- Topple inadequately secured poles

The Nelson-Tasman region experiences periodic strong nor'west and southerly wind events that create genuine structural risk for hop gardens. Wind damage to hop infrastructure can be expensive to repair — a full hop garden infrastructure replacement can exceed $100,000 per hectare.

### Frost

Frost at early growth (September–October) can damage emerging hop shoots and reduce the number of productive bines for the season. While established hop rhizomes are frost-hardy, the emerging shoots are frost-sensitive. A late spring frost can reduce crop yield without killing the plant, making the loss calculation more complex than for frost on tree crops.

### Drought and Irrigation Failure

Hop gardens are highly water-intensive during growth. Nelson-Tasman's relatively dry summer conditions mean irrigation is essential for most commercial hop operations. Irrigation failure — through system breakdown, power failure, or water availability restrictions — during the critical summer growth period can significantly reduce yield.

While drought itself may not be an insured peril under standard named perils policies, irrigation infrastructure — pumps, mainlines, dripper systems — can be insured under equipment breakdown and farm property covers.

## Understanding the Infrastructure Risk

A commercial hop garden represents substantial infrastructure investment that must be insured separately from the crop:

**Pole and wire system**: The structural backbone of a hop garden. Steel or timber poles set at regular intervals, with a complex wire system supporting the string and clips from which hop bines grow. Replacement cost can be $60,000–$120,000 per hectare depending on system type.

**Irrigation system**: Drip irrigation systems for most modern Nelson-Tasman hop gardens. Replacement cost for a comprehensive system runs to $5,000–$15,000 per hectare.

**Drying and processing facilities**: Commercial hop growers own drying kilns and sometimes pelletising equipment. These represent significant capital assets that require commercial property insurance separate from crop cover.

**Storage**: Hops are typically stored in refrigerated conditions after harvest. Cool store infrastructure and stored product cover are relevant.

## Insurance Structure for Hop Growers

### Crop Cover (Named Perils)

The annual crop should be insured under a named perils crop policy covering:
- **Hail**: The core peril — ensure this is a primary cover, not a sub-limit
- **Wind**: Given the physical vulnerability of hop structures to wind
- **Frost**: For early-season shoot damage
- **Fire**: Standard inclusion

**Sum insured**: Should reflect the expected crop value at current contract or spot market prices. NZ hop varieties achieving export premiums (Nelson Sauvin, Riwaka) have significantly higher per-hectare values than commodity varieties — ensure your sum insured is not understated.

### Infrastructure Cover

Hop garden infrastructure should be insured at replacement cost under a farm property or commercial property policy. Key assets to insure:
- Pole and wire system (at replacement cost for the current system type)
- Irrigation infrastructure
- Processing and drying facilities
- Cool storage

### Business Interruption

If significant infrastructure damage — for example, widespread pole and wire system failure from a wind event — forces you out of production for one or more growing seasons while infrastructure is rebuilt, business interruption cover provides income support during the recovery period. This is particularly relevant for hop growers where infrastructure restoration can take one or more full seasons.

## Insurance Providers for Hop Growers

**FMG** has experience with Nelson-Tasman hop growers and is the primary insurer in the region. Their Nelson-based rural advisers understand the specific risk profile of the Waimea Plains and Moutere Valley operations.

**Gallagher** can provide access to broader market capacity for larger hop operations or those seeking infrastructure cover limits that exceed domestic insurer capacity.

**Aon** has a presence in the Nelson-Marlborough market and can be relevant for larger operations.

## Contract Growing and Insurance

Many NZ hop growers operate under multi-year growing contracts with domestic or international brewing companies. Contract prices provide revenue certainty — but also mean that failure to deliver contracted volumes (due to a weather event) creates an obligation gap.

If your crop insurance pays out a claim, the settlement should cover the difference between your contracted revenue and your actual delivered revenue. Discuss with your broker how your contract values are reflected in your sum insured and claims settlement methodology.

## Premium Expectations for Hop Growers

As a guide for 2026 in the Nelson-Tasman region:

- Small hop garden (under 10 ha): $1,500 – $5,000/year for crop cover
- Medium commercial garden (10–30 ha): $5,000 – $14,000/year
- Large commercial operation: $14,000 – $30,000+/year

Infrastructure cover is additional and dependent on replacement cost values.

    content: `## Cyclone Gabrielle: A Watershed Moment for NZ Crop Insurance

On 12–14 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle swept across the North Island of New Zealand, bringing catastrophic flooding, wind damage, and landslides. Hawke's Bay was the hardest hit region — the Heretaunga Plains and Esk Valley experienced flooding on a scale not seen in living memory. Rivers broke their stopbanks, orchards were inundated with silt-laden floodwater, and agricultural infrastructure was destroyed across a region that is NZ's most productive horticultural area.

The damage to NZ's agricultural sector was staggering. Preliminary estimates put the total insured loss in Hawke's Bay horticulture alone in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Entire growing seasons were lost. Apple and pear orchards were buried under silt too deep to remediate quickly. Kiwifruit orchards on the Heretaunga Plains suffered widespread vine death from waterlogging. Vegetable growing districts were rendered unplantable for months.

Three years on, Cyclone Gabrielle has reshaped how NZ growers, insurers, and brokers think about crop insurance. Here is what was learned.

## Lesson 1: Cyclone Exclusions in Policy Wording Matter Enormously

One of the most distressing discoveries for some Hawke's Bay growers following Gabrielle was finding that their crop insurance policy contained a "named cyclone exclusion" — a clause that excluded coverage for damage caused by a named tropical cyclone. These exclusions are a legacy of marine and commercial insurance practice that had, in some cases, found their way into crop insurance policies without growers realising it.

Growers with named cyclone exclusions found themselves in a difficult position: wind, flood, and silt damage that was physically indistinguishable from damage covered under other perils was being treated as excluded simply because the event had been formally named.

**The lesson:** Read your policy wording carefully and specifically check whether your policy includes or excludes named tropical cyclone events. If you are uncertain, ask your broker to confirm in writing. This is a non-negotiable check before each renewal.

## Lesson 2: Silt Removal and Land Remediation Is Often Not Covered Under Crop Insurance

One of the most significant costs for Hawke's Bay orchardists following Gabrielle was not the immediate crop loss — it was the silt. Orchards buried under 30–60cm of silt required massive remediation: mechanical removal, soil testing, drainage restoration, and in many cases complete replanting.

Crop insurance policies cover the value of the lost crop. They do not generally cover the cost of removing silt from your orchard, restoring drainage, or remediating soil contamination. This cost falls into a gap between crop insurance, farm property insurance, and government assistance schemes.

**The lesson:** Ensure you understand exactly what your policy covers and does not cover after a flood event. Discuss with your broker whether land remediation costs can be added as an extension to your farm property or crop policy, or whether a separate rural property cover can address this gap.

## Lesson 3: Business Interruption Cover Is Not Optional for Larger Horticulture Operations

For orchards that suffered vine and tree death from waterlogging, Gabrielle created a multi-season income problem: even after silt removal and replanting, young trees or vines do not produce commercial yields for several years. A grower who replanted their kiwifruit orchard in 2023 will not return to commercial production until 2026 or 2027 at the earliest.

Growers without business interruption cover faced this multi-season income loss with no insurance support beyond the single-season crop loss payment. For operations with debt servicing obligations — mortgages, equipment finance — the absence of BI cover created genuine financial survival risk.

**The lesson:** Business interruption cover for horticulture operations must extend for long enough to cover the realistic recovery period. For perennial crops (kiwifruit, apples, grapes), BI cover should extend for at least 3–5 years following a catastrophic event that results in replanting.

## Lesson 4: Sum Insured Values Were Often Inadequate

Many Hawke's Bay growers discovered that their sum insured values — set at renewal the previous year — did not reflect current crop values at the time of Gabrielle. Between 2021 and 2023, both crop values and input costs increased materially. A sum insured based on 2021 figures left growers underinsured on their 2023 claims.

Additionally, some growers had insured on an input cost basis rather than a market value basis — meaning the insurance paid back input costs spent, but not the profit margin that would have been earned on a successful harvest.

**The lesson:** Review your sum insured at every renewal and ensure it reflects current market values, not figures from previous seasons. Consider insuring on a market value or revenue basis rather than just input costs.

## Lesson 5: Having a Broker Made a Measurable Difference

Growers who had specialist rural insurance brokers managing their policies consistently reported better claims outcomes than those who were insured directly or through general insurance brokers. Specialist brokers knew the policy wordings in detail, could identify and argue against unreasonable claim restrictions, and had established relationships with loss adjusters and insurer claim managers.

In the chaotic aftermath of Gabrielle, with thousands of claims being processed simultaneously, having an experienced advocate made a real difference to the speed and quantum of claim settlements.

**The lesson:** A specialist crop or rural insurance broker is not just a convenience — in a catastrophic claims environment, they are a significant practical asset.

## Lesson 6: Record-Keeping Is Critical and Often Overlooked

The growers who achieved the best claim settlements were those with comprehensive records: historical yield data by block and variety, input cost records, spray diaries, pre-event crop assessments, and infrastructure valuation documentation. Those without this data were at the mercy of assessors' estimates, which were not always generous.

For Gabrielle claimants, block-by-block yield history was particularly important: growers with detailed 5–7 year yield records per block received settlements based on realistic historical yields, while those without records received more conservative assessments.

**The lesson:** Maintain detailed records year-round. Treat your records as part of your risk management infrastructure, not just a compliance obligation.

## What Every NZ Grower Should Do Following Gabrielle's Lessons

1. **Check your policy for named cyclone exclusions** — if present, remove them or find a new insurer
2. **Add business interruption cover** — ensure the indemnity period is long enough for your crop type
3. **Discuss silt and land remediation cover** with your broker — understand the gap and options to address it
4. **Update your sum insured to current market values** — including input cost inflation and current crop prices
5. **Insure on a market value or revenue basis** — not just input costs
6. **Maintain detailed block-by-block yield records** — they will be critical in any major claim
7. **Work with a specialist rural or crop insurance broker** — not a general broker

Gabrielle was a severe test of the NZ crop insurance system. Growers who were well-insured and well-advised came through in a much stronger position than those who were not. The lessons are clear — the question is whether to act on them before or after the next major event. Contact our specialist brokers to review your programme today.`,

    content: `## Canterbury: NZ's Arable Farming Engine Room

Canterbury is the heartland of New Zealand's arable farming industry. The Canterbury Plains — stretching from the foothills of the Southern Alps to the Pacific coast — support NZ's most productive grain, seed, and arable crop production. Wheat, barley, ryegrass seed, canola, peas, and maize are grown across the region, supplying domestic flour mills, malting companies, seed merchants, and export customers.

The scale of Canterbury arable farming is significant. Individual farm operations of 500–2,000 hectares in crop are not unusual on the plains. Input costs per hectare for winter wheat or barley — seed, fertiliser, sprays, fuel, and contracting — can total $1,500–$3,000/ha, meaning a large Canterbury arable farm may have $500,000–$5,000,000 of input investment at risk in any given season.

## Key Risks for Canterbury Arable Growers

### Hailstorm

Hail is the primary insured risk for Canterbury arable farmers. Summer thunderstorms crossing the foothills can produce hailstorms that damage or destroy standing grain and seed crops. The Canterbury foothills zone — extending through Ashburton, South Canterbury, and Mackenzie Country — faces particularly significant hail exposure.

Hail damage to wheat and barley at heading or grain fill can cause:
- Physical grain shattering — hailstones impact and knock grain from the head
- Lodging — flattening of the crop stem, which can make harvest difficult and increase losses
- Straw and head damage that prevents combine harvester operation

Hail damage to ryegrass seed crops at seed set can be similarly devastating, particularly given the premium prices achieved by certified seed varieties.

### Fire

Fire is a significant risk for Canterbury arable crops, particularly during the dry Canterbury summer. Harvesting operations generate heat and risk sparks, and stubble fires can spread rapidly in wind. A paddock fire during harvest can destroy both the standing crop and harvesting machinery.

Cover for fire damage to standing crops is a standard inclusion in all Canterbury arable insurance and should not be overlooked.

### Wind and Lodging

Strong nor'west winds — characteristic of Canterbury — can cause lodging (physical flattening) of tall cereal crops, particularly wheat. Lodged crops are difficult to harvest efficiently, increasing harvest losses. Severe wind events can also cause physical crop damage and head loss.

### Drought

Drought is arguably the most significant uninsured risk for Canterbury arable farmers. Canterbury's climate is increasingly summer-dry, and while the region has the most extensive irrigation infrastructure in NZ (supplied by alpine-sourced rivers), some dryland or partially-irrigated operations face genuine drought exposure.

Standard named perils policies do not include drought. Options for drought cover in Canterbury include:
- **Multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI)**: Available through Gallagher and Aon accessing international markets, MPCI can include drought with a yield guarantee trigger
- **Parametric rainfall products**: Trigger-based payouts when measured rainfall falls below defined thresholds over specified periods
- **Irrigation infrastructure insurance**: Critical for irrigated Canterbury farms — ensuring pivot irrigators, pumps, and water races are fully insured

### Harvest Disruption

Extended wet weather during the Canterbury harvest period (January–March for many crops) can delay harvest, leading to quality deterioration in standing grain, seed losses through shedding, and increased weathering damage. Some specialist policies can include harvest disruption cover as an extension.

## FMG's Role in Canterbury Arable Insurance

**FMG is the dominant crop insurer in Canterbury's arable sector**, with deep experience in grain, seed, and arable risk across the plains. FMG's Canterbury-based rural advisers understand local conditions — including specific hail risk zones, fire risk during harvest, and regional drought patterns.

FMG offers:
- Named perils cover: hail, fire, wind
- Cover for a wide range of Canterbury arable crops including wheat, barley, ryegrass seed, canola, peas, and fodder crops
- Competitive pricing for the Canterbury arable sector, reflecting their market position and local risk knowledge
- Farm package policies that can integrate arable crop cover with farm property, vehicles, and liability

For most Canterbury arable operations, FMG should be the first quote obtained. Their Canterbury market experience is unmatched.

## Other Insurance Options for Canterbury Arable

**Gallagher** can access MPCI and parametric drought products from international markets — relevant for Canterbury operations where drought exposure makes the more comprehensive multi-peril protection worth the higher premium.

**Aon** has a South Island agribusiness presence and can serve larger Canterbury arable operations seeking sophisticated risk analytics alongside their insurance placement.

## Structuring Your Canterbury Arable Insurance Programme

### Named Perils Cover

For most Canterbury arable operations, named perils cover remains the core product:

- **Hail**: Essential — the core peril risk for Canterbury arable
- **Fire**: Standard inclusion — do not overlook this
- **Wind**: For lodging and direct crop damage in exposed areas
- **Sum insured basis**: Consider whether to insure at input cost or at expected yield value. For high-value seed crops or contracted grain, yield value basis provides more meaningful protection

### Drought Supplement

If drought is a significant concern for your operation, discuss MPCI or parametric options with your broker. The premium is higher but the coverage scope is dramatically broader.

### Irrigation Infrastructure

Canterbury's irrigation infrastructure — typically centre pivots or linear irrigators, along with pump sets, water races, and mainlines — represents significant capital investment. Ensure this infrastructure is insured at replacement cost under a farm property or commercial property policy.

### Harvest Machinery

Canterbury harvest operations use expensive contractor or owned combine harvesters, grain carts, and related machinery. Farm machinery and contractor liability insurance should be coordinated with crop cover.

## Premium Expectations for Canterbury Arable

As a guide for 2026:

- Small arable operation (under 200 ha in crop): $800 – $3,500/year for named perils cover
- Medium farm (200–500 ha): $3,500 – $9,000/year
- Large operation (500+ ha): $9,000 – $25,000+/year

Canterbury arable premiums remain among the most affordable crop insurance in NZ on a per-hectare basis, reflecting the relatively lower severity of crop losses compared to high-value horticultural crops. MPCI including drought cover carries a premium loading of 2–4x the named perils base premium.

Every NZ grower faces a version of the same question at renewal time: is crop insurance worth the premium cost, or would I be better off putting that money aside and absorbing losses from my own resources? It is a legitimate question — and for some growers in some situations, a version of self-insurance is a rational choice. But for most, the analysis tilts clearly toward buying insurance.

This article provides an honest framework for thinking through the crop insurance vs. self-insurance decision — including the situations where self-insurance can work, and the situations where it almost certainly cannot.

## What Self-Insurance Actually Means

"Self-insurance" is a term that sounds more structured than it usually is. True self-insurance means maintaining a dedicated financial reserve — a risk fund — that is specifically sized and set aside to cover the losses you are choosing not to insure. The reserve must be large enough to cover your worst-case realistic loss, accessible when needed, and not relied upon for other purposes.

In practice, most NZ growers who describe themselves as self-insured are not actually self-insured — they are uninsured. There is no dedicated reserve. If a crop fails, the loss is absorbed from whatever resources are available — equity in the farm, other income, debt. This is an implicit bet that no catastrophic loss will occur.

The distinction matters because uninsured losses have materially different financial consequences depending on when they occur and what other resources are available. An uninsured grower with strong equity and no debt can absorb a moderate crop failure. An uninsured grower with significant debt servicing obligations and a narrow equity margin cannot.

## When Self-Insurance Can Work

Self-insurance is a defensible strategy when:

**Your operation can genuinely absorb a worst-case loss**. This requires honest assessment of your financial position — not just in a good year, but in a year when a crop failure coincides with other financial pressures. If a total crop loss would be uncomfortable but survivable without threatening the viability of the business or your household, self-insurance may be reasonable for that crop.

**The premium cost is high relative to the expected value of claims**. Insurance is priced to generate an underwriting profit for the insurer. On average, growers pay more in premiums over time than they receive in claims — that is how insurance works. For crops with moderate and infrequent risk profiles, the long-run cost of insurance may exceed the expected value of protection. In this specific situation, self-insurance has a rational economic argument.

**You are insuring against small, frequent losses, not catastrophic events**. Self-insurance works best for high-frequency, low-severity risks where the averaging effect works in your favour over multiple seasons. It works worst for low-frequency, high-severity events (a once-in-a-decade cyclone, an unexpected major frost) where a single event can cause a loss that is impossible to absorb.

**You have genuine diversification across crops, regions, or income sources**. A grower with income from multiple unrelated crops, livestock, and off-farm income has a natural diversification that reduces the impact of any single crop failure. Diversification is itself a form of self-insurance.

## When Self-Insurance Does Not Work

Self-insurance is a poor strategy when:

**You have supply contracts with delivery obligations**. A contract grower who fails to deliver because of crop failure faces two hits: the loss of crop revenue, and potential contractual penalties. Insurance is specifically designed to cover the revenue shortfall — self-insurance leaves both exposures unaddressed.

**Your crop represents the majority of your income**. A lifestyle block supplementary income earner can absorb a bad year. A commercial orchardist or vegetable grower whose household income depends on crop revenue cannot.

**You have significant debt servicing obligations**. If your farm carries a mortgage, equipment finance, or input finance that requires seasonal repayment, an uninsured crop failure threatens your ability to service debt — potentially triggering a forced asset sale or receivership. Insurance is fundamentally about protecting your debt servicing capacity as much as it is about protecting income.

**Your potential loss exceeds what you can meaningfully reserve**. A 15-hectare commercial kiwifruit orchard might generate $600,000 in revenue in a good year. If a hailstorm destroys the crop, the loss is $600,000 less whatever processing revenue remains. No reasonable operating reserve covers this — you would need to hold $600,000 in liquid assets permanently idle to genuinely self-insure this risk. An annual premium of $15,000 to transfer this risk to an insurer is, by this analysis, dramatically cheaper.

**You are in a high-risk region or crop type**. Self-insurance is a bet that losses will be infrequent. In high-risk zones — Marlborough vineyards in frost hollows, Bay of Plenty kiwifruit in cyclone paths, Canterbury foothills orchards in hail zones — that bet is against the evidence. High-frequency risks are not good candidates for self-insurance.

## The True Cost Comparison

A common mistake in the self-insurance analysis is comparing the annual premium to the expected annual loss. The correct comparison is the annual premium to the financial impact of experiencing the worst-case loss at the worst possible time.

A $12,000 annual premium on a kiwifruit orchard might seem expensive if you have only claimed twice in fifteen years. But if one of those claims was $400,000 during a year when you also had significant off-farm expenses, the insurance provided enormous financial value — not just in claim dollars, but in protecting your ability to survive that year and continue operating.

The premium is not just buying claim payments. It is buying financial certainty — the guarantee that a catastrophic weather event will not threaten the viability of your business or your household.

## A Hybrid Approach: Partial Self-Insurance

The most sophisticated approach for many growers is a hybrid: buy insurance against catastrophic events while self-insuring smaller losses through a higher policy excess.

By accepting a meaningful excess — say $10,000–$20,000 per event — you can reduce your premium significantly while maintaining protection against the losses that matter most. You are effectively self-insuring the small claims (which you can absorb) and transferring the large claims (which you cannot) to the insurer.

This hybrid approach is often the optimal risk management structure for established, well-capitalised operations. Discuss the premium impact of different excess levels with your broker.

## Making the Decision for Your Operation

The crop insurance vs. self-insurance decision should be made explicitly and deliberately — not by default. Work through:

1. What is my realistic worst-case crop loss in a bad year?
2. Can my business survive that loss without insurance, given my debt position and other financial obligations?
3. Do I have supply contracts that create loss exposure beyond just the crop value?
4. What is the probability of a significant loss in my region and crop type?
5. What does insurance actually cost relative to the protection it provides?

    content: `## Infrastructure Is Often the Biggest Asset on a NZ Farm

When growers think about crop insurance, they typically focus on the crop — the annual revenue at risk from weather events. But for many NZ horticultural and arable operations, the infrastructure supporting crop production represents an even larger capital investment than any single season's crop value.

Consider a typical commercial kiwifruit orchard in the Bay of Plenty: the hail net system alone might be worth $1.5–3 million. Add the irrigation infrastructure, the packing shed, cool storage, the packhouse equipment, staff facilities, and general farm buildings, and the total infrastructure value can easily exceed $5–10 million — dwarfing the annual crop revenue.

This infrastructure is just as exposed to weather events and other risks as the crop itself. Cyclone Gabrielle demonstrated this comprehensively: in Hawke's Bay, orchards did not just lose their crops — they lost packing sheds, cool stores, irrigation systems, and in many cases the land itself was temporarily unusable. Growers without proper infrastructure insurance found themselves facing replacement costs that crop insurance did not address.

## Key Infrastructure Assets Requiring Insurance

### Irrigation Systems

Irrigation is not optional infrastructure for most commercial NZ horticultural and arable operations — it is the fundamental input that makes productive farming possible, particularly through the dry NZ summer.

**Canterbury pivot irrigators**: Centre pivot and linear move irrigators for Canterbury arable operations represent investments of $150,000–$500,000+ per unit. Canterbury farms typically run multiple pivots. Replacement cost insurance at current pricing is essential.

**Drip irrigation in horticulture**: Kiwifruit, apple, grape, and vegetable drip irrigation systems represent significant per-hectare investment — typically $5,000–$20,000 per hectare depending on system type. Damage from flood, frost (pipe freezing), or physical events requires immediate repair to maintain production.

**Pump sets and water extraction**: Pumps, pump houses, and water extraction equipment must be insured at replacement cost. For operations drawing from rivers or bore water, the pump set is a critical single point of failure.

**Water races and mainlines**: Ground-level water races and mainlines are vulnerable to flooding and physical damage. Canterbury water race networks in particular can suffer significant flood damage.

**What is typically covered:** Physical damage from fire, storm, flood, and accidental damage. Equipment breakdown cover is a separate, important extension for pump failure.

### Hail Netting Systems

Hail netting infrastructure is one of the most significant insured assets in NZ horticulture. For Nelson and Hawke's Bay apple orchards and Bay of Plenty kiwifruit, hail net systems represent a major capital investment:

- Permanent over-row hail net systems: $30,000–$80,000+ per hectare
- Moveable hail net systems: Lower initial cost but with annual installation labour

Hail nets must be insured at replacement cost — this means the current market cost of installing an equivalent new system, including materials and labour. Many growers under-insure their hail nets at historic cost rather than current replacement cost.

Damage events for hail nets include:
- Hail impact (ironically — a severe hailstorm can damage the nets that are designed to protect from hail)
- Wind events that collapse net structure
- Snow and ice loading in South Island orchards
- Physical damage from farm vehicles or falling trees

### Packhouses and Packing Facilities

The packhouse is often the operational hub of a commercial horticultural operation — and frequently among the most valuable buildings on the property.

Modern packhouses include sophisticated grading and sorting equipment, coolant systems, palletising equipment, and extensive electrical infrastructure. Replacement cost for a large commercial packhouse can reach $2–10 million including fit-out.

Packhouse insurance should cover:
- **Building structure**: At replacement cost, not market or book value
- **Fixed plant and equipment**: Grading lines, sorting tables, coolant systems
- **Electrical infrastructure**: Control systems, wiring, switchboards
- **Business interruption**: If packhouse damage prevents operation during harvest, the income loss can be severe

### Cool Stores and Post-Harvest Facilities

Cool storage is critical for managing post-harvest produce quality. Cool store failure — whether from structural damage or refrigeration system failure — can cause significant post-harvest losses.

**Structural cover**: Cool store buildings and refrigerated panels at replacement cost

**Equipment breakdown**: Refrigeration compressors, evaporators, and control systems are expensive to replace and are subject to mechanical failure. Equipment breakdown insurance covers the cost of mechanical or electrical breakdown of plant and machinery.

**Stored product cover**: If a cool store failure damages stored produce, a stored product extension can cover the value of produce that was already harvested and in storage. This bridges the gap between crop insurance (which ends at harvest) and the period when produce is in on-farm storage.

### Greenhouses and Protected Cropping Structures

Greenhouse structures for vegetable and flower production are expensive to build and maintain. Glass, polycarbonate, or polythene structures are vulnerable to hail, wind, and snow loading.

**Structural insurance**: At replacement cost for the structural components (frames, covering, gutters)

**Fixed plant**: Heating systems, ventilation, irrigation, lighting systems within the greenhouse

**Equipment breakdown**: Heating system failure during winter is a high-consequence risk for heated greenhouses — equipment breakdown cover should be included

### Farm Buildings and General Infrastructure

Beyond specialist infrastructure, most NZ farms have general buildings — implement sheds, workshops, staff accommodation, storage — that require proper insurance coverage.

**Common under-insurance issues:**
- Buildings insured at market value rather than replacement cost — if construction costs have risen (as they have significantly since 2020), market value may be well below replacement cost
- Buildings not updated for recent additions or upgrades
- Contents within buildings (tools, equipment, chemicals) not adequately listed

## Equipment Breakdown Cover: Often Overlooked

Standard farm property insurance covers physical damage from external causes (fire, storm, flood). It does not cover mechanical or electrical breakdown of machinery and equipment.

For operations with critical plant — irrigation pump sets, packhouse grading equipment, refrigeration systems, greenhouse heating — equipment breakdown cover is a critical extension. The cost of a failed pump during a critical irrigation period, or a grading line failure during harvest, can far exceed the premium for this cover.

## Coordinating Infrastructure Insurance With Crop Insurance

A common problem is growers having crop insurance with one insurer and infrastructure insurance with another, without the two programmes being properly coordinated. This can create:

- Coverage gaps at the boundary between crop and infrastructure (e.g., who pays when a hail event damages both the crop and the hail net?)
- Duplication of coverage creating unnecessary premium cost
- Claims disputes between insurers about which policy responds

**The solution:** Have a single specialist broker managing both your crop cover and your farm property/infrastructure cover. A coordinated programme ensures seamless coverage and eliminates gaps.

## Getting a Quote for Your Farm Infrastructure

Properly valuing and insuring farm infrastructure requires a thorough assessment of replacement costs — not book values or estimates.
