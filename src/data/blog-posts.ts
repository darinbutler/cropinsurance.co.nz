    content: `## What Is Crop Insurance?

Crop insurance protects growers against financial loss from crop damage or failure due to specified events. In New Zealand, two main types are available:

**Named Perils Insurance** covers specific, listed events such as hail, frost, fire, and wind. This is the most common form of crop insurance in NZ and is available from FMG, Gallagher, Aon, and specialist brokers. Premiums are generally lower than multi-peril cover, and the policy clearly defines what is and isn't covered.

**Multi-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI)** provides broader protection, guaranteeing a minimum yield or revenue regardless of the cause of loss. MPCI is more common in the United States and Australia but is increasingly available in NZ through specialist brokers accessing international markets.

## Who Needs Crop Insurance in NZ?

Any grower who would suffer significant financial hardship from a crop failure should consider crop insurance. This particularly includes:

- **Orchardists** with large capital investments in orchard infrastructure and perennial crops
- **Viticulture growers** exposed to frost and hail during the growing season
- **Arable farmers** with significant input costs who need income certainty
- **Contract growers** who face penalty clauses if they fail to deliver contracted volumes
- **Horticulture growers** with high-value per-hectare crops

## Key Things to Look For in a Policy

When comparing crop insurance policies, pay attention to:

1. **Sum insured basis** — is the policy based on expected yield value, market value, or input costs?
2. **Exclusions** — what perils are excluded? Pre-existing disease? Gradual deterioration?
3. **Waiting periods** — is there a waiting period before cover commences after taking out a new policy?
4. **Claims process** — how quickly will an assessor attend after a weather event?
5. **Sub-limits** — are there caps on individual peril claims?

## How Much Does Crop Insurance Cost in NZ?

Premiums vary significantly based on crop type, region, coverage level, and claims history. As a rough guide:

| Crop Type | Typical Annual Premium |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Kiwifruit (commercial orchard) | $2,500 – $18,000 |
| Apples / Pears | $1,800 – $14,000 |
| Grapes / Vineyard | $2,000 – $20,000 |
| Wheat / Barley | $800 – $8,000 |
| Stone Fruit | $1,500 – $12,000 |
| Vegetables | $700 – $9,000 |

The best way to get an accurate premium is to request quotes through a specialist crop insurance broker who can approach multiple insurers on your behalf.

    content: `## The Kiwifruit Industry and Its Risks

New Zealand is the world's third-largest kiwifruit producer, with the Bay of Plenty region at the heart of a $3+ billion export industry. The industry has come a long way since PSA (Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae) devastated orchards in 2010–2013, but growers today face an evolving range of risks.

## PSA Disease Coverage

PSA cover is one of the most frequently asked-about topics in kiwifruit insurance. The challenge is that PSA is a biological disease, and most standard named perils policies exclude disease. However, several options exist:

- **Business interruption cover** — if a PSA outbreak forces a significant reduction in your orchard's productivity, business interruption cover can compensate for lost revenue during the recovery period
- **Re-establishment costs** — some policies will cover the cost of vine removal, soil treatment, and replanting following a PSA-forced removal
- **Specialist disease cover** — available from select international markets accessed through brokers like Gallagher and Aon, though typically with significant sub-limits

## Weather Events: The Bigger Annual Risk

While PSA grabs headlines, weather remains the most consistent threat to kiwifruit orchards:

**Hailstorms** at flowering (typically September–October) or during vine growth can damage emerging shoots and fruit. Hail nets provide physical protection, but the nets themselves can be damaged and the installation cost (typically $30,000–$80,000/ha) should also be insured.

**Late frosts** in the Bay of Plenty are infrequent but catastrophic when they occur. Frost at flowering can destroy 80–100% of a crop.

**Cyclone & wind events** — Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023 caused significant damage to Bay of Plenty orchards, highlighting the importance of storm cover.

## What a Good Kiwifruit Policy Looks Like

A comprehensive kiwifruit orchard insurance programme typically includes:

1. **Standing crop cover** — hail, frost, wind, fire
2. **Orchard infrastructure** — hail nets, irrigation, packing shed
3. **Business interruption** — loss of income during recovery
4. **Post-harvest quality cover** — losses from storage or handling failures
5. **Liability** — public and product liability

## Getting a Quote

Given the complexity of kiwifruit insurance, we strongly recommend working with a specialist broker. Use our enquiry form to connect with an adviser who works specifically in the Bay of Plenty and horticulture sector.`,

    content: `## Why Frost Is the Biggest Single Risk for NZ Vine Growers

A severe frost event during budburst — typically August to October in NZ — can destroy 90%+ of a vineyard's annual crop in a single night. Marlborough, Hawke's Bay, and Martinborough all experience frost events capable of causing millions of dollars in crop losses across a region in a single event.

## How Vineyard Frost Insurance Works

Vineyard frost insurance operates on a named perils basis: the policy pays out when frost (defined as temperatures below a specified threshold, typically 0°C or -2°C at canopy level) occurs during the defined frost risk period and causes measurable crop loss.

Key features to look for:

- **Temperature threshold** — at what temperature does the policy trigger? Lower thresholds (e.g., -2°C) mean fewer triggers but more severe events are covered
- **Measurement methodology** — how is temperature measured? Grower's own on-site sensor, regional weather station, or independent assessment?
- **Loss assessment** — who assesses the crop loss? An independent loss adjuster's prompt attendance is critical
- **Season-end clause** — does the policy pay on the total seasonal shortfall or event-by-event?

## Parametric Vineyard Insurance

An emerging alternative to traditional indemnity insurance is parametric cover, available through specialist brokers like Gallagher. Parametric frost cover pays a predetermined amount when temperatures fall below a trigger threshold — no loss assessment needed. This provides faster claims payment and reduces the cost of loss adjustment.

## Other Key Vineyard Perils

Beyond frost, a comprehensive vineyard policy should cover:

- **Hail** at berry development (typically November–February)
- **Wind** damage to trellis wires and canopy
- **Smoke taint** from wildfire events
- **Disease** (some specialist covers available)
- **Winery infrastructure** — tanks, barrels, equipment

## Cost of Vineyard Insurance in NZ

Vineyard insurance premiums vary significantly based on variety, region, and frost risk. A Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc vineyard in a known frost hollow will pay a higher premium than a sheltered Hawke's Bay site. Expect annual premiums of $2,000–$20,000 depending on the size and risk profile of your operation.`,

    content: `## The Two Main Types of Crop Insurance

New Zealand growers have access to two fundamentally different types of crop insurance, and choosing between them is one of the most important decisions in structuring your risk management programme.

## Named Perils Insurance

Named perils insurance covers specific events that are explicitly listed in the policy. Common named perils for NZ crops include:

- Hail
- Frost
- Fire
- Wind / Windstorm
- Flood / Excess Moisture
- Lightning
- Snow/Ice

**Advantages:** Lower premiums. Clear, easy-to-understand coverage. Widely available from NZ insurers including FMG.

**Disadvantages:** If your crop fails for a reason not on the list — drought, pest, disease — you're not covered. Can feel inadequate after a "grey area" event.

## Multi-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI)

MPCI provides an all-risks guarantee: you are covered for crop loss from any natural cause, subject to defined exclusions. The policy typically guarantees a minimum yield or revenue (e.g., 70% of your historic average yield).

**Advantages:** Comprehensive protection. Covers drought, which is excluded from most named perils policies. Provides income certainty for planning.

**Disadvantages:** Higher premiums. Less widely available in NZ — typically requires access to international markets via specialist brokers. More complex claims process.

## How to Choose

Consider MPCI if:
- You grow high-value crops with large input costs
- Drought is a significant risk in your region (Hawke's Bay, Canterbury)
- You have supply contracts with significant penalty clauses
- Your operation is large enough to justify the higher premium

Consider Named Perils if:
- Your main risk is a specific weather event (e.g., hail for orchards)
- Premium cost is a primary consideration
- You want a simple, straightforward policy

## Getting the Right Advice

The best approach is to have a frank conversation with a specialist crop insurance broker who can present both options with comparative pricing. Our broker network can access both named perils policies from NZ insurers and MPCI products from specialist international markets.`,

    tags: ['hail insurance', 'orchard', 'kiwifruit', 'apples', 'horticulture'],
    content: `## Why Hail Is the #1 Insured Risk for NZ Orchardists

Hailstorm damage is the single most commonly claimed weather event across NZ's horticultural insurance sector. A hailstone the size of a marble can leave permanent surface scarring on kiwifruit, apples, or stone fruit that renders the crop unfit for premium fresh market export — even if the fruit itself is otherwise healthy.

## How Hail Damage Affects Different Crops

**Kiwifruit:** Hail scars on the skin affect export grade. Hail at flowering can shred petals and prevent fruit set. Major hail events can cause 40–80% crop loss.

**Apples & Pears:** Surface scarring from hail stones is the primary damage mechanism. Class 1 export-grade fruit must be essentially blemish-free. Hail-damaged fruit is downgraded to juice or processing grade at a significant price discount.

**Grapes:** Hail at berry development can puncture skins, leading to botrytis infection and complete loss of affected bunches. A single hail event can destroy an entire vintage.

**Stone Fruit:** Cherries are particularly vulnerable — hail scarring and subsequent infection can render an entire harvest unmarketable.

## Hail Cover vs. Hail Nets: Do You Need Both?

Hail netting systems are now standard in many of NZ's premium apple and kiwifruit orchards. However, hail nets and hail insurance are complementary — not alternative — risk management tools:

- Hail nets protect the fruit but can be damaged themselves (and are extremely expensive to repair/replace)
- Hail nets don't protect flowering crops, understorey, or infrastructure
- Insurance covers what nets can't — including net replacement costs

## What to Look For in a Hail Policy

1. **Assessment methodology** — how quickly will a loss adjuster attend? Look for 48-hour response commitments
2. **Grading standards** — does the policy pay based on your specific export market grading standards?
3. **Partial loss provisions** — how are partial crop losses assessed and settled?
4. **Net coverage** — is your hail netting infrastructure included in the sum insured?

## Timing Your Cover

Hail insurance must be in place before a hail event occurs — this seems obvious, but many growers leave renewal too late. Most insurers want policies in place by late July/August for the coming NZ growing season.`,

    content: `## The Changing Face of Weather Risk in NZ Agriculture

New Zealand's agricultural sector is experiencing an intensification of weather-related risks that is directly impacting crop insurance markets. Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 caused an estimated $14 billion in damage across Hawke's Bay and Tairāwhiti, including catastrophic losses for horticultural growers. This single event was a watershed moment for NZ crop insurers.

## Premium Trends for NZ Crop Growers

Following Cyclone Gabrielle and a string of significant weather events, NZ crop insurance premiums have increased materially in affected regions:

- Hawke's Bay horticultural premiums increased 20–40% for the 2023–24 season
- Flood-exposed areas in Tairāwhiti saw some cover withdrawn temporarily
- Kiwifruit growers in low-lying Bay of Plenty orchards faced tighter terms

However, the picture is not uniformly negative. Insurers are investing in better risk modelling, and growers who invest in risk mitigation (drainage improvement, windbreaks, frost protection systems) can negotiate better terms.

## What Growers Can Do

1. **Invest in risk mitigation** — insurers reward demonstrable risk reduction (drainage, hail nets, frost protection) with better terms
2. **Shop the market** — not all insurers are repricing the same crops equally. Use a broker to access multiple markets
3. **Consider parametric products** — parametric weather insurance is less affected by claims history and can offer more stable pricing
4. **Review your sum insured** — rising input costs and land values may mean your sum insured is inadequate even if premium rates hold steady

## The Broker Advantage

In a hardening insurance market, an experienced rural insurance broker becomes even more valuable. Brokers with strong insurer relationships can advocate on your behalf, access markets not available direct, and structure covers that balance protection and cost.`,

    tags: ['small growers', 'lifestyle block', 'market garden', 'affordable crop insurance'],
    content: `## Do Small Growers Need Crop Insurance?

The short answer: it depends on how much financial impact a crop failure would have on you. A lifestyle block grower selling at a farmers' market might absorb a bad season. A small commercial vegetable grower with a supermarket contract cannot.

## When It Makes Financial Sense

Crop insurance makes sense for smaller operations when:

- You have supply contracts with minimum delivery obligations
- Your crop income represents a significant portion of your household income
- Your growing season input costs are substantial
- You're in a high-risk area for hail or frost

## Options for Smaller Operations

**FMG** will consider smaller horticultural operations and offers competitive terms for lifestyle blocks and small orchards with commercial intent.

**Farmcover** specialises in competitive premiums for smaller farms and can arrange basic named perils cover for market gardens and small orchards.

**Package policies** — rural property and contents policies from rural insurers sometimes include limited crop cover as part of a broader farm package, which can be cost-effective for smaller operations.

## The Minimum Worth Insuring

As a rule of thumb, crop insurance becomes cost-effective when your annual crop revenue exceeds $30,000–$50,000 or when you have contractual obligations that would create losses if you fail to deliver.

    content: `## Acting Quickly Is Critical

After a hailstorm, frost, or other weather event damages your crop, time is of the essence. Insurers typically require notification within 24–48 hours, and prompt action helps ensure an accurate assessment before evidence deteriorates.

## Step 1: Notify Your Broker or Insurer Immediately

As soon as you identify crop damage that may be covered by your policy, call your broker or insurer. Don't wait to assess the full extent of damage — early notification protects your claim rights.

## Step 2: Document Everything

Before touching or harvesting the damaged crop:

- Photograph damage thoroughly (close-up and wide-angle)
- Record date, time, and weather conditions
- Note the estimated area affected
- Keep any weather bureau or news reports of the event

## Step 3: Do Not Harvest or Remediate Without Permission

Insurers require the opportunity to inspect the damage before harvest or remediation. Harvesting damaged fruit early or applying remedial treatments without insurer approval can jeopardise your claim.

## Step 4: Loss Adjuster Assessment

A loss adjuster (usually an independent specialist) will be assigned to assess your claim. For horticultural crops, this typically involves:

- Physical inspection of affected areas
- Comparison with reference samples
- Review of historical yield records
- Assessment against policy triggers and thresholds

## Step 5: Settlement

Once assessment is complete, the insurer will provide a settlement offer. Review this carefully — if you disagree with the assessment, you have the right to request a review or appoint your own independent assessor.

## Tips for a Smooth Claim

1. Keep detailed crop records (yield history, spray diaries, harvest records)
2. Know your policy excess and how it applies
3. Understand your policy basis (first loss, proportional, etc.)
4. Your broker should advocate for you throughout the process — if they're not, find a better broker`,

    content: `## Overview

New Zealand growers have access to several specialist crop insurance providers. The three dominant players are FMG (Farmers Mutual Group), Aon NZ, and Gallagher, each with distinct strengths and target markets.

## FMG – Farmers Mutual Group

**Best for:** NZ farmers wanting a farmer-owned insurer with nationwide rural adviser support

FMG is New Zealand's largest rural insurer and has been supporting NZ farmers for over 100 years. As a mutual, FMG's profits are retained to benefit policyholders rather than paid to external shareholders. FMG employs over 100 rural advisers throughout New Zealand, providing genuine face-to-face service in farming communities.

**Strengths:** Unmatched NZ rural expertise, nationwide adviser network, strong claims reputation, farmer-owned ethos
**Potential limitations:** Primarily NZ market capacity (no London/international market access for complex risks)

## Gallagher NZ

**Best for:** Larger commercial growers needing international market capacity or complex risk structures

Gallagher is a global insurance broker with specialist agribusiness teams. For large-scale NZ operations — major kiwifruit orchards, large vineyards, contract vegetable growers — Gallagher can access London and international insurance markets that NZ domestic insurers cannot. This means broader coverage, higher limits, and access to parametric products.

**Strengths:** Global market access, specialist agribusiness brokers, parametric products, large risk capacity
**Potential limitations:** Less grassroots NZ farming focus, better suited to larger operations

## Aon NZ

**Best for:** Growers who value data-driven risk analytics and global broker expertise

Aon combines global risk analytics capability with a dedicated NZ agribusiness practice. Aon is particularly strong in vineyard and viticulture insurance and brings sophisticated risk modelling tools to help growers understand and quantify their exposure.

**Strengths:** Risk analytics, viticulture expertise, global capacity
**Potential limitations:** Premium pricing reflects global broker overhead

## Farmcover

**Best for:** Smaller farms and lifestyle blocks wanting competitive premiums

Farmcover offers straightforward, competitive crop and farm insurance with a focus on smaller NZ farming operations. Less complexity means lower overhead and competitive pricing.

    content: `## The Growing Cost of Extreme Weather for NZ Growers

New Zealand agriculture has always faced weather risk — but the frequency and severity of extreme events is increasing. Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 caused an estimated $14.5 billion in total damage, with the Hawke's Bay horticulture and viticulture industry among the hardest hit. Orchards were buried in silt, crops destroyed, and infrastructure washed away. Growers without adequate insurance faced total loss.

Understanding what extreme weather cover is available — and where the gaps are — is essential for any NZ grower.

## The Main Extreme Weather Perils and Insurance Coverage

### Cyclone and Wind Damage

Tropical cyclones, ex-tropical lows, and windstorms are covered under most named perils crop insurance policies. The key variables are:

- **Named storm exclusions**: Some older policies exclude named tropical cyclones. Check your policy wording carefully.
- **Infrastructure vs. crop**: Wind damage to structures (packing sheds, irrigation systems, hail nets) may be covered separately under a farm or commercial policy rather than crop cover.
- **Business interruption**: If a cyclone forces you to stop operations for weeks or months, BI cover can be critical — but it is often not included in base crop cover and must be added as an extension.

### Frost Damage

Frost is one of the most commonly claimed weather perils for NZ horticulture growers. Key points:

- **Budburst timing**: For orchards and vineyards, cover must typically be in place before budburst commences. Attempting to insure after a frost warning has been issued will likely result in a declined application.
- **Sub-limits**: Some policies place sub-limits on frost claims — particularly for early season frosts where the full scale of damage may not be evident immediately.
- **Canterbury and Central Otago**: Late spring frosts in October and November can damage stone fruit, pip fruit and vine crops at their most vulnerable stage. Regional underwriting can affect premium rates significantly.

### Hailstorm

Hail is the single biggest insured peril for NZ pip fruit and horticulture growers. A single hailstorm lasting 10 minutes can render an entire orchard's crop commercially unsaleable. Cover considerations:

- **Hail-only vs. named perils**: Some growers opt for hail-only cover as a lower-cost option. This works well if hail is the dominant risk but leaves gaps for other perils.
- **Hail net discounts**: Insurers will typically discount premiums for orchards with certified hail netting in place. This can significantly reduce the cost of cover.
- **Grading and bruising thresholds**: Not all policies pay out at the same damage threshold. Some require a minimum percentage of fruit to be affected before a claim is triggered.

### Drought

Drought is one of the most underinsured risks in NZ agriculture. Standard named perils policies typically do not include drought cover — it is considered a gradual deterioration rather than a sudden, specified event. Options for drought cover:

- **Multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI)**: MPCI policies, particularly those available through international underwriters, can include drought as a covered peril with a yield guarantee trigger.
- **Parametric insurance**: A relatively new option in NZ, parametric policies pay out automatically when a measured index (e.g., rainfall below a defined threshold over a specified period) is triggered — no loss assessment required.
- **Irrigation infrastructure**: While drought cover on crop is limited, insuring irrigation infrastructure (pivots, pumping systems, drains) is standard and important.

### Flooding and Waterlogging

Post-Gabrielle, flooding has become a heightened concern. Most crop policies will cover flood damage to standing crops. However:

- **Silt damage and remediation costs**: The cost of removing silt from orchards is significant and may not be covered under a crop policy — it may fall under a land remediation or farm policy.
- **Quality vs. physical damage**: Flood-damaged fruit that cannot be harvested cleanly may result in quality downgrade claims rather than total loss claims, which can affect pay-out amounts.

## Are Premiums Rising Due to Climate Risk?

Yes. Insurers and reinsurers globally are recalibrating their pricing models to reflect increased extreme weather frequency. NZ growers are seeing the effects:

- Hail and wind premiums in exposed regions (Hawke's Bay, Marlborough, Bay of Plenty) have increased by 15–35% over the past four years.
- Some insurers have reduced capacity in high-risk postcodes or introduced higher excesses for cyclone perils.
- Multi-year claims histories are being weighted more heavily in underwriting decisions.

Working with a specialist broker who has access to multiple markets is increasingly important — the difference between the most and least expensive quote for the same cover can be substantial.

## What to Check Before the Season

Before each growing season, growers should review:

1. Is your sum insured still accurate given changes in crop value or expansion of planted area?
2. Have you updated your broker on any new infrastructure, irrigation, or hail netting installed?
3. Are there any new perils you should be adding cover for?
4. Is your policy in place before any key risk window opens (budburst, flowering, harvest)?

Our specialist brokers can run a pre-season policy review at no cost. Contact us to arrange this.`,

    content: `## What Drives the Cost of Crop Insurance in NZ?

Crop insurance premiums in New Zealand are calculated based on a combination of factors that reflect the specific risk profile of each growing operation. Understanding these factors can help you anticipate what you might pay — and identify ways to reduce your premium.

**Key factors in crop insurance pricing:**

- **Crop type and value per hectare**: High-value crops like kiwifruit, grapes, and stone fruit attract higher premiums in dollar terms than lower-value arable crops, even at similar percentage rates.
- **Region and microclimate**: Growers in frost-prone valleys (Central Otago, Marlborough, Hawke's Bay) or cyclone-exposed coastal areas pay more than those in more sheltered locations.
- **Coverage level**: Named perils cover is cheaper than multi-peril cover. Revenue protection is the most expensive but provides the broadest guarantee.
- **Sum insured**: Whether you insure at input cost, expected yield value, or market value affects both premium and claims outcome.
- **Claims history**: Growers with recent claims will pay more. A clean history can earn lower rates over time.
- **Infrastructure**: Hail netting, frost protection systems and good on-farm biosecurity can all attract underwriting discounts.
- **Deductible/excess**: A higher excess reduces your premium but increases your out-of-pocket exposure on any claim.

## 2026 Indicative Premium Ranges by Crop

The following are indicative annual premium ranges based on typical NZ commercial operations in 2026. Actual premiums will vary based on the factors above. These are guides only — use our quote form for a personalised figure.

### Kiwifruit (Gold and Green)
- Small orchard (under 5 ha): $2,500 – $6,000/year
- Medium orchard (5–15 ha): $6,000 – $14,000/year
- Large commercial (15+ ha): $14,000 – $35,000+/year

Named perils cover only (hail, frost, wind): approximately 1.5–3.5% of insured value per annum. Gold variety orchards often attract lower rates due to better yield predictability.

### Apples and Pears
- Small orchard (under 10 ha): $1,800 – $5,000/year
- Medium orchard (10–30 ha): $5,000 – $14,000/year
- Large operation (30+ ha): $14,000 – $30,000+/year

Hail-only cover (most popular for pip fruit): typically 0.8–2% of insured value. Orchards with hail nets installed can see discounts of 25–50%.

### Grapes and Vineyards
- Small vineyard (under 10 ha): $2,000 – $6,000/year
- Medium vineyard (10–30 ha): $6,000 – $18,000/year
- Large operation (30+ ha): $18,000 – $45,000+/year

Frost is the dominant premium driver for most Marlborough operations. Frost cover can account for 60–70% of total premium cost.

### Wheat, Barley and Arable Grain
- Small arable farm (under 200 ha in crop): $800 – $3,000/year
- Medium farm (200–500 ha): $3,000 – $9,000/year
- Large operation (500+ ha): $9,000 – $20,000+/year

Arable cover is generally the most affordable crop insurance in NZ in per-hectare terms. Multi-peril cover is more commonly sought by larger Canterbury and Southland operations.

### Stone Fruit (Cherries, Peaches, Nectarines, Plums)
- Small orchard: $1,500 – $5,000/year
- Commercial orchard: $5,000 – $16,000/year

Cherries attract the highest premiums among stone fruit due to their high value per hectare and vulnerability to rain damage at harvest.

### Hops
- Small hop garden (under 10 ha): $1,200 – $4,000/year
- Commercial hop garden: $4,000 – $12,000/year

### Vegetables
- Small operation (under 20 ha): $700 – $3,000/year
- Large commercial: $3,000 – $12,000/year

## Has the Cost of Crop Insurance Increased Recently?

Yes. NZ crop insurance premiums have trended upward in recent seasons, driven by:

- **Global reinsurance cost increases**: Following major international weather events (Turkey earthquake, Australian floods, NZ Cyclone Gabrielle), reinsurers increased rates, which flows through to direct premium pricing.
- **Increased loss frequency in NZ**: Several consecutive seasons with significant weather events have pushed NZ insurer loss ratios higher.
- **Labour and input cost inflation**: Higher crop values mean higher sums insured and higher premiums in dollar terms even at the same rate.

Typical premium increases in the 2024–2026 period have ranged from 10–30% depending on crop type and region. Growers in areas impacted by Cyclone Gabrielle have seen more significant adjustments.

## How to Reduce Your Crop Insurance Premium

1. **Install hail netting**: The most effective way to reduce hail premiums for orchardists. Many insurers offer 25–50% discounts for certified hail net installations.
2. **Invest in frost protection**: Active frost protection (helicopters, sprinklers, wind machines) is recognised by insurers and can reduce frost cover premiums.
3. **Choose a higher excess**: Accepting a higher deductible on small claims reduces your premium while maintaining protection against catastrophic loss.
4. **Maintain a clean claims history**: A sustained period without claims builds goodwill with your insurer and can unlock lower rates at renewal.
5. **Use a specialist broker**: Brokers who access multiple markets simultaneously can identify the most competitive pricing available for your specific risk profile.

    content: `## The Hidden Risk for NZ Export Crop Growers

Growing a successful crop is only half the challenge for New Zealand's export horticulture sector. Getting it off the farm, into cold storage, onto a vessel, and delivered to international markets — at the right quality and on time — is the other half. And increasingly, that journey involves significant risk.

New Zealand's top export crops — kiwifruit, apples, wine, onions, and squash — depend on a global logistics chain that has been under significant pressure since 2020. COVID-era disruptions reshaped supply chains, and ongoing geopolitical tensions — particularly in the Middle East following the Iran-US conflict escalation in 2024–2025 — have added new layers of uncertainty for growers and exporters.

## The Impact of Geopolitical Tensions on NZ Crop Export Logistics

### Red Sea and Suez Canal Disruptions

The escalation of attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea from late 2023, and the subsequent rerouting of vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, added 10–14 days to transit times between NZ and European markets. For fresh produce like apples, kiwifruit, and stone fruit, extended transit times are not just inconvenient — they directly affect product quality on arrival.

For NZ export growers, the practical impacts included:

- **Increased freight costs**: Cape of Good Hope routing added 25–40% to shipping costs on NZ-Europe routes in 2024.
- **Cold chain integrity risk**: Longer transit times increase the risk of quality deterioration, particularly for sensitive produce like kiwifruit and cherries.
- **Port congestion**: Vessels avoiding the Suez added to congestion at Cape ports, creating knock-on delays at NZ loading ports.

### The Iran-US Conflict and Insurance Exclusions

The broader conflict involving Iran and US-aligned nations in the Middle East in 2024–2025 had two important insurance implications for NZ export growers:

**War and Political Risk Exclusions in Marine Cargo Policies**: Standard marine cargo policies include war exclusion clauses. Vessels transiting through or near conflict zones may void cargo insurance coverage unless a specific war risk extension has been purchased. Growers and exporters need to confirm with their insurer or broker whether their marine cargo cover includes war risk extension — and whether routing through affected regions triggers exclusions.

**Premium Increases for Middle East Routes**: War risk premiums for Middle East routing increased dramatically following the conflict escalation. This cost is typically borne by the exporter or shipping line and flows through to freight rates.

## What Insurance Covers for Export Crop Growers

### Marine Cargo Insurance

Marine cargo insurance covers physical loss or damage to goods in transit — including from the farm packhouse to the overseas buyer's warehouse if required. For NZ export crops this is critical. Key cover areas:

- **Physical damage in transit**: Crushing, contamination, breakage
- **Temperature excursion**: Most policies for fresh produce include temperature failure cover for refrigerated containers
- **Vessel general average**: If a vessel incident requires cargo to be jettisoned or damaged to save the ship, cargo holders may face general average contributions — marine cargo insurance covers your share
- **War risk extension**: Covers loss from war, strikes, riots, and civil commotion in transit zones — essential for Middle East routing

### What Marine Cargo Does NOT Cover

- Market price decline on arrival (quality deterioration that is not caused by an insured peril)
- Customs delays or detention
- Rejection by the importer for contractual or quality reasons unrelated to transit damage
- Regulatory import restrictions or market access changes

### Crop Insurance vs. Marine Cargo: Where Does One End and the Other Begin?

A common area of confusion is the handover point between on-farm crop insurance and off-farm transit cover. Generally:

- **Crop insurance** covers loss or damage while the crop is growing, at harvest, and typically through to delivery to the packhouse or cool store.
- **Marine cargo insurance** takes over once the crop leaves the packhouse and enters the logistics chain.

There can be gaps at the transitional points — particularly during post-harvest storage and cool store periods. A specialist broker will identify these gaps and ensure continuity of cover.

## Revenue Implications of Logistics Disruption

Beyond direct physical loss, logistics disruption has revenue implications that standard crop insurance does not cover:

- **Price collapse due to oversupply**: If shipping delays cause NZ kiwifruit or apples to arrive in Europe at the same time as competing origins, prices can fall sharply.
- **Contract penalties**: Some supply agreements include delivery windows with financial penalties for late shipment.
- **Relationship damage**: Repeated late or poor-quality deliveries can affect long-term market access and pricing.

Revenue protection insurance (available as a structured crop insurance product from specialist brokers) can partially address revenue shortfalls — but it does not specifically cover logistics-driven revenue loss. Trade credit insurance is a separate product that can cover buyer non-payment risk for export transactions.

## What Should NZ Export Growers Do?

1. **Review your marine cargo cover annually**: Ensure your policy includes temperature excursion cover, war risk extension (if routing through affected regions), and covers the full transit chain.
2. **Confirm cover for the transitional period**: Ensure there is no gap between when your crop insurance ends and your marine cargo insurance begins.
3. **Talk to your broker about routing changes**: If your exporter changes shipping routes due to geopolitical conditions, notify your broker — routing changes may affect your cover.
4. **Consider revenue protection**: For export-dependent operations, revenue protection insurance provides a safety net against price and volume shortfalls regardless of cause.
5. **Keep records of logistics costs**: In the event of a claim related to transit disruption, documentation of freight costs, cold chain records, and delivery timelines will be critical.

    content: `## The Premium Pressure NZ Growers Are Feeling

If your crop insurance renewal has come in noticeably higher than last year, you are not alone. Across New Zealand's horticulture and arable sectors, premiums have risen materially over the 2023–2026 period. Understanding why this is happening — and what you can realistically do about it — is the first step to managing your insurance cost effectively.

## The Four Main Drivers of Rising Crop Insurance Premiums

### 1. Global Reinsurance Hardening

Most NZ crop insurers pass a significant portion of their risk to global reinsurers — large international firms like Munich Re, Swiss Re, and Lloyd's syndicates that take on the tail risk of catastrophic events. Following a series of major global natural disasters (Australian floods, Turkish earthquake, Pacific cyclones), the global reinsurance market hardened sharply from 2022 onwards. New Zealand, as a small market on the edge of the Pacific, has limited negotiating power in this environment. Reinsurance cost increases flow directly into local premium rates.

### 2. Cyclone Gabrielle and the NZ Claims Environment

Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023 was the costliest natural disaster in NZ history. The agricultural losses in Hawke's Bay — covering kiwifruit orchards, apple and pear operations, vegetable growing districts, and livestock — pushed insured agricultural losses to record levels in a single event. Insurer loss ratios deteriorated significantly, and premium adjustments followed at the next renewal cycle for most growers.

### 3. Higher Crop Values Driving Higher Premiums in Dollar Terms

Even where premium rates (as a percentage of insured value) have remained stable, higher crop values — driven by rising commodity prices, export demand, and input cost inflation — mean higher premiums in dollar terms. Kiwifruit orchard valuations, vineyard land values, and per-hectare revenue for top-quality apple operations have all increased materially since 2020.

### 4. Increased Frequency of Smaller Events

Beyond the headline cyclone event, NZ growers have experienced above-average frequency of smaller weather events — frosts, hailstorms, and wind events — in recent seasons. These smaller, more frequent claims have pushed insurer combined ratios higher, prompting broad-based premium adjustments rather than just event-specific ones.

## What Growers Can Do to Manage Rising Premiums

### 1. Don't Automatically Renew — Compare the Market

The most common mistake growers make at renewal is accepting the incumbent insurer's offer without testing the market. Premiums for the same coverage can vary by 20–40% between insurers for the same risk. A specialist crop broker with access to multiple insurers can do this comparison for you — at no cost.

### 2. Review Your Sum Insured

Over-insurance is surprisingly common. If your insured value hasn't been reviewed in two or three years, it may not reflect current market conditions. Equally, under-insurance leaves you exposed. An accurate sum insured means you are paying premium only for the risk you actually carry.

### 3. Invest in Physical Risk Reduction

- **Hail netting**: The most proven way to reduce hail risk and unlock insurer discounts. Premium discounts of 25–50% are available from most insurers for certified hail net installations.
- **Active frost protection**: Wind machines, helicopter contracts, or overhead irrigation frost systems are recognised by underwriters and can reduce frost premium loading.
- **Biosecurity protocols**: For disease-sensitive crops, demonstrable biosecurity investment can support lower disease-related loadings.

### 4. Consider a Higher Excess

Accepting a higher deductible reduces your premium while maintaining protection against the large losses that would genuinely threaten your business. Review whether your current excess reflects your capacity to absorb smaller losses.

### 5. Consider Multi-Year Arrangements

Some insurers offer multi-year premium arrangements that lock in rates for two or three years in exchange for certainty of renewal. In a rising market, these can represent good value — though they reduce your flexibility if your risk profile changes.

### 6. Consolidate Your Cover with One Broker

Growers who have farm insurance, vehicle, crop, and marine cargo cover spread across multiple brokers and insurers often miss opportunities for portfolio discounts. A single broker managing your full agricultural insurance portfolio is better positioned to negotiate on your behalf.

## Looking Ahead: Will Premiums Continue to Rise?

The global reinsurance market showed some stabilisation in late 2025 as capital returned to the market following strong earnings years. However, NZ-specific factors — including ongoing climate variability and the ongoing repricing of cyclone and wind risk following Gabrielle — suggest that meaningful premium reductions are unlikely in the near term.

The practical implication for NZ growers: active management of your insurance programme, working with a specialist broker, and investing in physical risk reduction measures will deliver better outcomes than passive renewal.
