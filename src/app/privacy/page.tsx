              <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>We collect personal information you provide directly via our quote request and contact forms. This may include your name, email address, phone number, crop type, growing region, estimated crop value, and any additional information you choose to share about your farming operation. We also collect standard website analytics data (page views, referrer sources, device type) through privacy-respecting analytics tools to improve the website experience.</p>

              <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <p>We use your contact information solely to forward your enquiry to a licensed NZ insurance adviser or broker who specialises in crop and rural insurance. This allows them to contact you, understand your requirements, and provide appropriate insurance advice and quotes. We do not use your information for marketing purposes without your explicit consent, and we do not sell or share your information with third parties other than the licensed advisers we refer you to.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Adviser Referrals</h2>
              <p>When we forward your enquiry to a licensed broker or adviser, that adviser will receive your contact details and the information you provided in the quote form. From that point, your information is also subject to the adviser's own privacy policy. Licensed advisers are required to comply with the Privacy Act 2020 and their obligations under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.</p>
